# Coffee Break!

Over the years, URLs have changed as I moved between service providers and rethought what posts were important to save. Instead of redirecting every page, check the [Archive](/archive). If you think something is missing that needs my attention, reach out via the contact information on the [About page](/about).

Going [home](/) is also a valid choice.
