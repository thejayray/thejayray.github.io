I had a conversation with a friend about [Charles Bukowski's 'Don't Try' philosophy](https://bukowski.net/dont-try.php), which seems at odds with [yesterday's resolution](/baby-steps/):

> Somebody asked me: "What do you do? How do you write, create?" You don't, I told them. You don't try. That's very important: not to try, either for Cadillacs, creation or immortality. You wait, and if nothing happens, you wait some more. It's like a bug high on the wall. You wait for it to come to you. When it gets close enough you reach out, slap out and kill it. Or if you like its looks, you make a pet out of it.

I think it still fits. My plan is to take a prompt, write whatever (if anything) comes of it, and hope that something will eventually arrive to make a pet out of.
