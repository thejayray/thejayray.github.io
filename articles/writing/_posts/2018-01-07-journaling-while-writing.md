I've started adding 'Journal' Groups to my @ulyssesapp projects if I find anything _meta_ to note while working on them. Rather than keeping a separate writing log, this approach keeps ad hoc notes permanently related to whatever-it-was that inspired them. 

If you use tags then they can be re-surfaced under one or more Filters defined at the top level your Library, which also keeps them tied together and readable as a whole. I use 'Lessons Learned' and tags of 'do' and 'do not do'. 

Even if the containing project is ever archived or moved off into another Group, the top-level Filter remains active and readable.
