<p><span>But it’s hard to get riled up about such posts any more. Given Microsoft’s position in the tablet space, this whole thing just reads as sort of sad.</span></p>

<p>Speaking of the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_blog/archive/2013/10/23/apples-and-oranges.aspx" title="Apples and Oranges - Microsoft Blog">blog post by Microsoft&#8217;s Frank Shaw</a>, I have had a number of conversations on this subject and it all comes down to just how unimportant Microsoft now is in the landscape of computing. My comment: &#8220;How many more missteps does it take before Microsoft realizes that it is not in a good place?&#8221; Apparently, a few more. Enjoy your Surface 2, no one!</p>

<p><br/><strong>Update</strong> (10/24&#160;1:13pm): Dave Mark has a fantastic rant over on <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/10/24/microsofts-frank-shaw-calls-out-apple-and-the-reality-distortion-field/">The Loop</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a taste:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Really Frank? How many tablets in the world have Word on them? How many have Pages? I would wager that any iPad productivity app will have more “traction” than any comparable Surface app.</p>
  
  <p>And I use my iPad every single day, all without a single bolted on aftermarket input device, just the ones I was born with.</p>
