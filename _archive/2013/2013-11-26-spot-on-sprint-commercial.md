<p>This post contains a commercial spot that I saw last Friday that is part of Sprint&#8217;s new ad campaign, starring James Earl Jones and Malcolm McDowell. Although I think the overall premise is odd, especially given the fact that people&#8217;s Facebook pages are not that interesting to me, this one is spot on in my opinion. Unfortunately, the video was nowhere to be found until recently, which strikes me as odd, possibly because I am an Apple fan and Apple is quick to host their ads on their website. Nevertheless, it made me chuckle, which is saying something for a Facebook-themed Sprint commercial.</p>
