  <p>There’s no meaning in “it gets technology out of the way,” as Google is wont to say, because Glass is intended to always be in the way, to become a part of us in a much more literal way than smartphones have.</p>

<p>The above is the reason why so many people are put off by Google Glass. It really has nothing to do with the technology itself but more to do with the pedestal on which Glass users will place that technology, as though the technology comes before anything else in priority.</p>

<p>So I will simply echo Kyle&#8217;s sentiment: &#8220;disturbing&#8221;.</p>
