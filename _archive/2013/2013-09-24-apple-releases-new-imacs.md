<p>Everyone seems surprised that the iMac refresh occurred prior to the release of OS X Mavericks, but I still think the new Mac Pro and MacBook Pros will accompany the operating system. In addition, I think the main contention is the fact that the iMacs will ship with what will soon be an old OS, but the problem is the assumption that the OS X update will cost money. I&#8217;m still not one hundred percent, but the price of the iOS versions of iWork and iLife for new users only steadies my resolve that there is a sea change with regard to <a href="/2013/07/free" title="Free - Engineered Eloquence">Apple&#8217;s pricing of their software</a>.</p>
