  <p>Most of this whole discussion is based on the expectation that Nintendo will continue (and must continue) being as dominant as they were during the Wii/DS years. But these years were a fluke. Nintendo never did that well before, and possibly won’t do that well again. Fortunately, it doesn’t have to.</p>

I&#8217;m going to continue to watch and you can get the full scope of my coverage <a href="http://links.engineeredeloquence.com/tagged/Nintendo" title="Nintendo coverage on Engineered Eloquence">here</a>.</p>
