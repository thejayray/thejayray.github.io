title: [Ben Bajarin: Not Switching](http://techland.time.com/2013/07/22/why-im-not-switching-from-the-iphone/)

<blockquote>
  <p>I wrote last year in a column that our technology picks are simply matters of personal preference. Because someone chooses Android and another chooses the iPhone isn’t a big deal, and it’s certainly not something worth arguing about. The fact that I’m not switching to Android or any other platform isn’t a big deal.</p>

<p>I generally read every Ben Bajarin article I could get my hands on because he is so thoughtful and laid back in his opinions. <a href="http://verynicewebsite.net/2013/07/why-im-not-switching-from-the-iphone/" title="John Moltz's Very Nice Website">Moltz agrees</a> that Bajarin is &#8220;one of the good ones&#8221;. Finding a person who is opinionated but not militaristic is a breath of fresh air in the current technological landscape and that is unfortunate.</p>

<p>In this article, Bajarin&#8217;s ability to make a logical argument against the previous discussions and redefine the conversation to that of smartphone maturity is uncanny. I consider myself a mature smartphone user and I have tried every platform I can, but in looking back on what drew me to each platform over the years, I am reminded that I came back to iOS because it &#8220;just worked&#8221; every time. In other words, less worry, more productivity.</p>

<p>However, in Bajarin&#8217;s words: &#8220;The fact that I’m not switching to Android or any other platform isn’t a big deal.&#8221; <strong>Or, at least, it shouldn&#8217;t be.</strong></p>
