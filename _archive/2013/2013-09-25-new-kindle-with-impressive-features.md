<p>I don&#8217;t normally post about non-Apple hardware, especially when I have never had personal experience with the devices, but some of the features as expounded upon by The Verge in the above video are impressive. I think Amazon really has a good idea of what consumers need, so the moves in features like &#8220;Mayday&#8221; and &#8220;X-Ray&#8221; are definitely going to be enticing into the future of the tablet space.</p>
