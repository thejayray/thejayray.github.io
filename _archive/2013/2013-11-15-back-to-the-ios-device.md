<p>In &#8220;OS X Mavericks features that&#8217;d be great to see in iOS 8&#8221;, Rene Ritchie has a good start to the list of items that need to make the jump from OS X to iOS in the next or upcoming versions. Mavericks is the first operating system where I feel I will use most (if not all) the new features. My only additions to Rene&#8217;s list would be the obvious ones that I have written about previously and others have decried as heinous omissions of late: <a href="/2013/07/tagged-follow-up/#tagsonios" title="Tagged: Follow-up - Engineered Eloquence">better document handling</a> (a la All My Files section in Finder) and <a href="/2013/06/apples-sneak-attack-on-the-file-system/" title="Apple’s Sneak Attack on the File System - Engineered Eloquence">tagging</a>.</p>
