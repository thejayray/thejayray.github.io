title: [The 75 — 20 — 5 Rule](https://medium.com/tech-blogging/43d78a82e103)

<p>MG Siegler:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By the time I had read a few hundred articles, I had my thesis for what I’ll call the “75 — 20 — 5 Rule”.</p>
  
  <p>That is, on any given day, I’d say 75 percent of what you read in the tech press is somewhat accurate, 20 percent is complete bullshit, and 5 percent is actually true.</p>
  
  <p>&#8230;</p>
  
  <p>Those with knowledge of the actual truth rarely speak out because, what’s the point? In our age of breakneck news cycles, a story will likely be forgotten about the next day unless you make a stink about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have severely cut down on what sources I read and whom I trust in my reading because there is so much misinformation out there now; in addition, some of the misinformation is planted for political or maniacal reasons. I may not have many followers on the Internet, but one of the things I have always promised to those who do was to not post until it was something discerned and honest.</p>
