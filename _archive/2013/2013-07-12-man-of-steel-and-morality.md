<p>My wife and I went to see <em>Man of Steel</em> this weekend and while my expectations were not overly high, I was disappointed with the ending, which I will not spoil here. However, the ending provided me with a desire to research Superman lore in the attempt to reconcile this new style of Superman with the comic book hero&#8217;s past.</p>

<p>In my research I found this well-written Entertainment Weekly article, which discusses the typical superhero scenarios, as well as some nice looks into broad-spectrum morality, Alan Moore, Superman, and President Obama. <em>In addition, there need to be spoilers for this type of discussion, so don&#8217;t click the link unless you have seen the movie or don&#8217;t care.</em></p>

<p>I can&#8217;t really choose a good blockquote, so I will let the article as a whole stand on its own. Enjoy!</p>
