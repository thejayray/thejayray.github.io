<p>Living in Indianapolis, I have had a number of conversations about the Indy 500 (<em>an event I don&#8217;t and never will follow</em>). However, instead of discussing the winner or the strategies and broken records, the conversations regarded crashes; how is that entertaining?</p>

<p>Now I understand a little better&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>WWDC is like NASCAR: You come for formulaic display of American ingenuity, but you stay for the horrific crashes and burnouts. And nothing has crashed so horrifically in recent years like tech journalism, specifically Apple-focused journalism.</p>
