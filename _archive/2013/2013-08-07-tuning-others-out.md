  <p>Muting is for nerds; tuning out others is mainstream. The problem Matt writes about is a huge one.</p>

<p>A great conversation has begun that started with <a href="http://one37.net/blog/7/8/2013/muting" title="Muting - One37">Matt Alexander&#8217;s</a> discussion of muting within social networks. While I don&#8217;t always agree that muting as a practice is a bad thing, I like Mr. Hackett&#8217;s follow-up, which gets at the heart of the issue: egotism. People like to believe that their point of view is the right one and surround themselves with others that agree with them. Americans are especially bad at being held accountable or being challenged and many of us hate confrontation, even when constructive. Thankfully, I <em>know</em> very few people agree with my views, so it is hard to delude myself into that notion.</p>
