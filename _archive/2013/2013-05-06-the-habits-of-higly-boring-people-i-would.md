<p><span>I would definitely suggest watching the video since it constitutes less than 15 minutes of your time and is rather inspiring, but I have listed some of the information from it below if you are a reader more than a watcher. Either way, kudos to Chris on a great explanation of how &#8220;being boring&#8221; can be turned into &#8220;being revolutionary&#8221; just in a shift in state of mind. </span></p>

<p><em><strong>NOTE</strong>: The &#8220;Jay Notes&#8221; are my reinterpretations of his explanation. Otherwise, the rest of the information is quoted from the video.</em></p>
