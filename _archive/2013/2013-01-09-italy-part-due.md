<p>Well, we&#8217;re back and better that ever!</p>



<p>The weather was perfect, albeit a little cold, Rome was great for Christmas, and Florence was great for New Year&#8217;s. Meanwhile, Lexi and I stayed mostly disconnected from the Internet, often stealing away to Facebook to share a photo or two, but overall a successful reorientation of priorities on each other. All in all, Italy was a fascinating time for me and there are many a blog post that will be written specifically because of (or in spite of) my experiences there.</p>



<p>In the meantime, I wanted to discuss New Year&#8217;s resolutions since it is almost always a hot topic at the beginning of a year. I will, as in previous years, forego the process of setting unrealistic goals for myself that will inevitably be relegated to the pile of failures that is endemic of such ideas.</p>



<p>Instead, I decided to make a list of the things that I want to do this year, almost as a subjective bucket list, as listed below (what follows is a truncated list):</p>



<ol><li>Get more sleep</li>

<li>Listen to more music</li>

<li>Watch less TV</li>

<li>Read more for pleasure</li>

<li>Learn another language</li>

<li>Purge distractions, both digital and physical</li>

</ol><p>As can be seen, I am setting forward ideas of what I would like to focus on this year. Each of the listed items is not measurable from the perspective outside of my own head, but I will know if I am succeeding or failing at any one of them over time during the year.</p>



<p>I felt that last year was overly focused on my graduate studies, which meant that reading for pleasure was basically nonexistent and TV was the easiest way to unwind. This year, I want TV will take a back seat to music and audiobooks or leisure reading and hanging out at coffee shops.</p>



<p>How I normally choose to spend my time was often a focal point of the trip to Italy, which I did not expect. In fact, I think I turned a corner in Italy that I didn&#8217;t know was coming (even bringing me to tears one evening): I am ready to part with childish things to become a man (Corinthians 13:11).</p>



<p>I always come back to the initial step, about which I wrote in <a href="/2012/12/going-legit" title="Going Legit">Going Legit</a>. The fact is that the closer I come to where I want my life to be, even in the afore-listed terms, the further I am from where I began. In other words, as I mature, I am not closing in on something, I am instead getting further away from my current state of mind.Â </p>



<p>The next step, and possibly a more difficult one, for another post entirely is my ability to pick and choose how and where I spend my time or possibly how I deal with the realization that how I may spend my time is worth less than it should be.</p>



<p>Probably not what many of you expected to read about in a post about Italy, but the trip was a crossroads for me that I will be attempting to understand for many months to come.</p>
