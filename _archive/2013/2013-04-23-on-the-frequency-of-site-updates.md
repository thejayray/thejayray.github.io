title: On the Frequency of Site Updates
---

<p>I wanted to apologize for my recent absence on this site. The way that I wanted to run it was to post at a frequency of about once per week. For the first couple months, I was able to keep up with this. As most of you are aware, <a href="/2013/04/with-death-comes-new-life" title="With Death Comes New Life - Engineered Eloquence">I recently entered a new, and rather daunting, part of my life</a> that has commanded much of my time. In addition, I have become busy with work and helping out Lexi&#8217;s school with recent productions, both musical and theatrical; in other words, fun but time-consuming.</p>

<p>Either way, however, I had writer&#8217;s block. Each time I sat down with a little extra time, the cursor blinked, pounding on a blank document like the pulse in my brain, devoid of any new information to communicate. This post is therefore my return to form, my hope that I am able to start over and get back to where I want to be. I have many drawing board, long form items that I am looking forward to writing, a few items that should have been published but have been sitting unfinished for far too long, and I want to start discussing my preparation and thoughts on fatherhood. Also, I have had a couple of people mention that I need to start sharing my thoughts on cooking (including recipes and more generally), get back to technology more in my writing, and discuss social justice concerns while living in a place like Indianapolis. I will attempt to hit each of these and other topics as time goes on.</p>

<p>In the coming months, I plan to purchase my domain and rethink my use of Tumblr, as my publishing platform. If anyone has any thoughts or suggestions on this note, please drop me a line on <a href="http://twitter.com/jayray" title="@JayRay - Twitter (Same on ADN)">a social network</a> or through email. I have looked into Wordpress and Squarespace, as the former is used by many people I know and the latter looks to be one of the best hosted offerings in the space. In each case, the price is a barrier to entry, since this site is not meant to be anything but a hobby for the time being.Â </p>

<p>In the meantime, thank you for continuing to read and I hope that we can continue to grow together, as I bring you more of my thoughts, concerns, and meanderings on all sorts of subjects.</p>

<p>See you next time,</p>

<p>Jay Ray</p>
