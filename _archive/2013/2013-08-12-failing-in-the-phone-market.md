  <p>Still, that needn’t have been the end for BlackBerry, or Nokia for that matter. Both were viable enterprises in 2009 and into 2010. But then both made the exact same strategic error: they didn’t know what they were good at, and consequently threw their differentiation away.</p>

<p>I used a Blackberry for a time as well as a many Nokia &#8220;dumb&#8221; phones over the years. It has been sad to watch such prominent figures in the phone market simply give way under their own weight and idiocy. Ben Thompson has a good look at what their strengths were and subsequently how both companies squandered their respective leads in the marketplace.</p>
