<p>I have started watching <em>Orange is the New Black</em> on Netflix and really like what I have seen so far. Liz Shannon Miller at paidContent likes it as well and uses it to solidify <a href="/2013/05/fox-nbc-and-netflix-a-difference-in-priorities" title="Fox, NBC, and Netflix: A difference in priorities - Engineered Eloquence">a commentary I had</a> about the difference between a service like Netflix and the TV networks of old. The difference is priorities and Netflix prioritizes good content versus good numbers because they know what it is people like. I used Arrested Development&#8217;s newest season as the basis for my thoughts, but I think <em>Orange is the New Black</em> is an even better basis for this type of argument, as the show is compelling, perhaps even more so than Arrested Development or any of Netflix&#8217;s other original series have been.</p>
