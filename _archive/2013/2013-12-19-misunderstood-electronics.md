<p>I had wanted to share this video yesterday, but simply didn&#8217;t get to it since I was on the road all day, with an infant no less. Federico Viticci has a good look at the commercial and I will be honest that the first time I watched it, I missed a lot of the nuance that Federico noticed and took the time to explain in a way only he can. I hope that Apple continues to make commercials of this caliber, especially given the way the commercial encourages follow-up for people that want to do these same things on their own. To my family this holiday season, I will field your questions!</p>
