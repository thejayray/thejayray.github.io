<blockquote>
  <p>Treat places like Medium the way you’d treat writing for someone else’s magazine, for free. It serves the same purpose: your writing gets to appear in a semi-upscale setting and you might temporarily get more readers than you would elsewhere, but you’re giving up ownership and a lot of control to get that.</p>

<p>I was invited to start writing on Medium. I even went as far as setting up my user account, but I had already started to write and share each day on this site, so its purpose was somewhat lost on me, especially given the fact that Medium suggests that you not repost items on their site. I think <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3015252/why-you-should-be-your-own-platform" title="Why You Should Be Your Own Platform">Glenn Fleishman&#8217;s original article</a> for Fast Company and Marco Arment&#8217;s post here are prescient and well-stated. If I were ever to post on that site, I would definitely get more reads, but the content would no longer be mine and there is no guarantee that those readers would follow me back here. In addition, I am not in the business of making money for other people while categorically against advertising on my own site.</p>
