  <p>Something is rotten in the state of boys&#8217; education, and I can&#8217;t help but suspect that the pattern I have seen in my classroom may have something to do with a collective failure to adequately educate boys. The statistics are grim. According to the book Reaching Boys, Teaching Boys: Strategies That Work and Why, boys are kept back in schools at twice the rate of girls. Boys get expelled from preschool nearly five times more often than girls. Boys are diagnosed with learning disorders and attention problems at nearly four times the rate of girls. They do less homework and get a greater proportion of the low grades. Boys are more likely to drop out of school, and make up only 43 percent of college students. Furthermore, boys are nearly three times as likely as girls to be diagnosed with Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Considering 11 percent of U.S. children&#8212;6.4 million in all&#8212;have been diagnosed with a ADHD, that&#8217;s a lot of boys bouncing around U.S. classrooms.</p>

<p>Fascinating information regarding teaching boys effectively. I think that as we move into a world where more and more information is in digital form, we will run into a problem where sitting still is integral to the learning experience. There needs to be a way to mitigate the fallout for the male gender, however, to insure that even as we move toward all digital information, we provide for the high energy, high curiosity characteristics that are apparent in males in early development.
