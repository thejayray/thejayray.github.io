<p>I&#8217;ve heard mixed things about the movie and I am not sure how I will feel about it since the portrayal of Steve Jobs is so personal to so many people, but I more likely than not to go see the film. Kutcher&#8217;s answers made me feel a little more hopeful for, if nothing else, his performance as Steve Jobs. This sentiment of sudden trust comes mainly from the following quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If this film becomes an enduring memory, of a man I admire, I wanted to ensure that it was portrayed by someone who cared about his legacy and took the time to represent him in a way that people who were close to Steve felt to be authentic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The rest of the answer is also worth a read. <em>Of course, if you dislike Kutcher, neither his answer nor his actual performance will help you.</em></p>
