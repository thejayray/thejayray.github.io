<p>Funniest thing about this article to me is that I hadn&#8217;t noticed a few of these inconsistencies in my daily use. I guess I just don&#8217;t use these utilities myself very often. However, it is a little disconcerting that there are simple UI items like this that are forgotten; seems very un-Apple-like to be less than detail-oriented, especially given Apple&#8217;s past, self-assumed penchant for such details. Good write up, though, of some items that obviously need fixing.</p>
