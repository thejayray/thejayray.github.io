<p>I love when The Oatmeal tells it like it is. The discussion of Columbus is made more poignant after reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_in_the_White_City" title="The Devil in the White City - Wikipedia">The Devil in the White City</a>, which frames <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Holmes" title="H. H. Holmes - Wikipedia">America&#8217;s first serial killer</a> against the backdrop of the Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Arguably one of America&#8217;s finest moments commemorates a man who really shouldn&#8217;t be so popular.</p>
