<p>If this article isn&#8217;t an argument for the idea that the Sears Tower (now, Willis Tower&#8230; whatever) in Chicago is still the tallest building in the world (based on usable space), I don&#8217;t know what is.</p>

<p>Also, what is the point of a tall tower if you can&#8217;t actually take advantage of the views?!</p>
