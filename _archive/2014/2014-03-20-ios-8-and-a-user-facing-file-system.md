  <p>Tools like Preview and Tags would make iOS more powerful and more flexible, and I don&#8217;t know anyone who would complain about that. Apple&#8217;s Tags technology isn&#8217;t a true user-facing file system, but they might be as close as we&#8217;ll ever see on iOS.</p>

<p>Stephen and I see eye to eye on what Apple should do with regard to the iOS file system, utilizing tags and a generic application like Preview as a hub for all files that are not photos, music, or otherwise taken care of by a stand-alone application. Interestingly enough, I wrote two articles (<a href="/2013/06/apples-sneak-attack-on-the-file-system/" title="Apple's Sneak Attack on the File System - Engineered Eloquence">here</a> and <a href="/2013/07/tagged-follow-up" title="Tagged: Follow-up - Engineered Eloquence">here</a>) on the subject about a year ago that doubled as a review of the Mavericks Developer Preview and a discussion surrounding the power of tags, both now and in the future with integration in iOS. I sure hope Stephen and I are right!</p>
