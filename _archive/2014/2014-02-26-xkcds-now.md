<p>I almost didn&#8217;t believe it, but today&#8217;s XKCD is dynamic and updates with the time of day. Not only a fascinating use of simple web technologies, but also awesome because the comic suggests the best and worst times to call someone throughout the day, no matter their time zone. Click-through to see the comic in action!</p>
