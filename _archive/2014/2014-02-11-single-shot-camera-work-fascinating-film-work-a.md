<p>Fascinating film work! A recreation of six iconic images in a single uninterrupted shot. I remember watching Alfred Hitchcock&#8217;s The Rope as a kid and loving what it took to make a movie a continuous shot (although Hitchcock used some fancy camera work to cut at opportune times), just like the stream of consciousness of the human mind. These filmmakers did a fantastic job, though I wonder how many takes it took to get to the final product.</p>
