<p>There has been a lot of attention paid to this new Apple ad. I really like the ad, but that is not what I am surprised about. I&#8217;m just surprised that no one has stated what seems obvious to me: this is an ad from Apple post Beats acquisition. This is an Apple that wants to be much more mainstream and wants to be seen (<em>again</em>) as the cool kid. The music, the use of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/22/some-brief-thoughts-about-apples-macbook-air-stickers-ad/" title='"Bangs and dents mean these things get used." - Matthew Panzarino, TechCrunch'>beat-up Macs</a>, the throwback Apple Logo, and, for lack of a better term, the beats all make me think we are in for a new era of Apple advertising that is more on the level with the much-lauded Beats advertisements of recent memory.</p>
