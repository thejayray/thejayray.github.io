<p>The best thing about this workstation is that I designed something similar only a few months ago, as I was attempting to make my home-office workstation accommodating to my desire to stand, as well as my desire for minimalism. It is less necessary now that I have an iMac in that spot, but was a perfectly reasonable solution when I planned to only ever use a laptop there. Perhaps one day, I will simply purchase the Podpad for myself. Beautiful work!</p>
