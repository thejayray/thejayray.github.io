  <p>I&#8217;ve wrestled a lot in life with some problematic perfectionist tendencies. An irritating idealism that sometimes makes me cranky or hard to work with and other times serves as a sorry excuse for throwing in the towel or not following through. I&#8217;ve burnt out on certain hobbies, or become impatient with steep learning curves where mastery appeared very distant. As I&#8217;ve gotten older I&#8217;ve learned to muster more self discipline, pick my battles more wisely, and be more patient with myself and others. It&#8217;s still a work-in-progress.</p>

<p>This post to the Frequency blog on Tonx.com resonated with me on a number of levels. Heart-felt, straight-forward, and realistic is this view of the beauty (and equality) of coffee.</p>

<p>In one of the recent episodes of &#8220;<a href="http://www.cosmosontv.com" title="Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey">Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey</a>" there was a short discussion of the emergence of the cafe and more importantly coffee as the great equalizer among scientific minds and commoners; Tony&#8217;s ideas lead to the same subtext in my mind. All things being equal, the coffee itself and even the equipment, coffee made at home by me can be as good as something made by a world-class barista.</p>

<p>It is posts like this one that I will miss if they go away with the merging of Tonx and Blue Bottle Coffee.</p>
