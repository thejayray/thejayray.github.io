<blockquote>
  <p>Yes. As they ripen, some fruits, like apples and pears, produce a gaseous hormone called ethylene, which is, among other things, a ripening agent. When you store fruits together, the ethylene each piece emits prods the others around it to ripen further, and vice versa. (Fun tip: Want to quickly ripen an avocado? Stick it in a paper bag with an apple overnight.)</p>

<p>Fascinating information about an age-old phrase. Is it bad that my take away from this article was a better way to ripen my avocados and nectarines?</p>
