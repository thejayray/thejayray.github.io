<blockquote>
  <p>Researcher Marcia Hurlow has shown that many errors “disappear” from student writing when students focus on their ideas and stop “trying to ‘sound correct.’”
  &#8230;
  One of these is a program at Arizona State in which students who test below college-level in their writing ability immediately begin writing college essays. More than 88 percent of these students pass freshman English—a pass rate that is higher than that for students who enter the university as college-level writers.</p>

<p>I wanted to share this article since I thought it was fascinating when I originally marked it as &#8220;Liked&#8221; through Instapaper. I remember absolutely hating grammar growing up, as grammar meant rules and hinderances to the writing process. Now, I love grammar by virtue of the fact that I sit and write and want to know how to be a better writer. Apparently, I am not the first one to think that writing in and of itself is the way to learn (as well as learn to love) grammar.</p>
