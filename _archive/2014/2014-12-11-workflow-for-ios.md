>In the years I've spent covering iOS automation, I've often asked for a mobile version of Automator. Workflow, released today, tries to bring the deep system integration of Apple's OS X utility to the iPhone and iPad, taking advantage of extensions in iOS 8 to make its automation features ubiquitous and compatible with any app.

Workflow was an insta-buy for me; I have been waiting for such an application for awhile. I enjoy using apps like Launch Center Pro for automation, but the use of URL Schemes always seemed a bit out-of-touch from the reality of how most people use their iOS devices. Workflow for iOS is way beyond URL Schemes and is truly desktop-class software. The running joke today: "Hopefully Apple doesn't pull it."
