  <p>Cool new stuff is cool and new, but let us also be mindful and intentional of our consumption habits and our lifestyles. Let’s consider what’s most important to the improvement of our lives and workflows, let’s celebrate craftsmanship and well-made products that are built to last, and let’s be content with not upgrading everything we own all the time (even though we want to).</p>

<p>The new site looks beautiful and I am looking forward to a lot of the new content, especially given the importance of the message above. Good work and congratulations to all those involved.</p>
