<p>I got the news today that <a href="https://editorially.com" title="Editorially">Editorially</a> was closing their doors. Editorially is—<a href="http://brooksreview.net/2014/02/editorially-shuts-its-doors/" title="Editorially Shuts Its Doors - The Brooks Review">was</a>—a high quality web application whose focus was specifically on clean writing interfaces and collaboration in writing. I only used editorially a few times, but really liked to design ideas and attempt to rethink word processing, especially given the recent <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/76086019487/excel-the-last-microsoft-office-stronghold" title="Excel: The Last Microsoft Office Stronghold - ParisLemon">sentiments toward Office hatred</a>.</p>

<p>My only thought: Apple should hire the entire team and have them work on the iWork apps.</p>
