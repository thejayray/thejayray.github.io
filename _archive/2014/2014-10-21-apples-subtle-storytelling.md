<blockquote>
  <p>But look behind the exploded iMac. Behind the new &#8216;TCON&#8217; there&#8217;s a girl holding her father&#8217;s hand. Not brought to the centre of the frame, not inflated to be the story of the video, just a consequence of this device being in their home. That&#8217;s incredible storytelling. That&#8217;s Apple.</p>

<p>Short post, but a powerful message. Apple is all about the details and if you are the type of person who appreciates the work that goes into such details, you are probably a fan of Apple.</p>
