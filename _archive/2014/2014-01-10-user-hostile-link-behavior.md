<blockquote>
<p>Most people know how to open your article’s outbound links in new tabs or windows, especially readers of a tech site. Modern browsers make multiple-tab/window management very easy for almost everyone who wants them, and the people who don’t know how to manage them usually don’t want them.</p>
<p>The best practice for the modern web is to let people manage their own windows and tabs.</p>

<p>On previous iterations of this site, I had always used the &#8216;target=&#8221;_blank&#8221;&#8217; item in my link markup, mainly due to the fact that I was using Tumblr&#8217;s built-in editor, which made it an easy, single click away. However, I read <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/designing-blogs-for-readers/" title="Designing blogs for readers - Matt Gemmell">a post by Matt Gemmell</a><sup id="fnref:p72890448165-1"><a href="#fn:p72890448165-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> that showed me the light regarding its user hostility. Now, every time I visit a site that directs me to a new tab when I click a link, I let out an audible groan.<sup id="fnref:p72890448165-2"><a href="#fn:p72890448165-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> With the move to Markdown for all of my writing, in addition to the fact that I now dislike the behavior, I left it behind by virtue of the fact that Markdown leaves it out by default.</p>

<p>Either way, the behavior is, at best, simply unnecessary cruft in a website design (or ignorance) and, at worst, an actively user-hostile choice. For experiences that show signs of the latter, I honestly hope that website designers get with the times.</p>

<p>See the section entitled, Hypertext Etiquette, for all the rules. I agree with every single one and suggest you read the entire post if you are a blogger or want to know more about designing a website&#8217;s behavior specifically for reading. <a href="#fnref:p72890448165-1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>

<p>It is actually one of the reason why I no longer read <em>The Verge</em>. The site has tons of links and each one directs me to a new tab. As Arment says, give me (or any reader for that matter) the choice of how to manage my open items. <a href="#fnref:p72890448165-2" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
