I wanted to update the day it came out, but of course I didn’t have enough space! Where was I meant to sit and find time to delete 5GB worth of space? Impossible. I let it go for the next few days, I was in no rush. About 75% of my friends in school updated within the first few days, well the ones who had space obviously. They weren’t that impressed with it. I eventually updated using ITunes [sic] after Karan told me I could, not having to delete stuff after all. I wasn’t impressed either.

iOS 8 isn’t a flashy updated [sic] like iOS 7, and most users won’t realize the power of it until at least a year when all the major Extensions and Widgets become commonplace. I think this also confirms that the 5&#160;GB requirement for an OTA Update is definitely contributing in holding up the Adoption Rate.

<p>I immediately knew that the storage required by the iOS 8 OTA update was going to be an issue for Apple. My mother always updates immediately when there is something available and she had to hold off to &#8220;delete stuff&#8221; and &#8220;make room&#8221;. I still don&#8217;t understand how Apple is selling a 16GB phone for $200, but then again they are <em>still</em> selling an 8GB iPhone 5C as well. Good luck with that.</p>
