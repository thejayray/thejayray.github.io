<p>Recently, I <a href="/2014/04/ios-8-wishlist-and-macstories-redesign/" title="iOS 8 Wishlist - Engineered Eloquence">linked</a> to a post on MacStories that discussed a wish list of items for iOS 8. I came away from that post feeling underwhelmed since I truly hope Apple refocuses to stabilize what they started with iOS 7, instead of adding features for the sake of adding features and coming out with something more buggy.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, however, Ben Brooks came out with a similar wish list of items he would like to see in iOS RSS readers. I hope it is not hypocritical to be nodding my head the entire time I read Ben&#8217;s post after my reaction to Federico&#8217;s post. Nevertheless, if an RSS reader came out that did any one of the items listed in Ben&#8217;s list, let alone all of them, I&#8217;d pay whatever they were asking. I especially would like be able to write and post items like this one to my blog from within an RSS app.</p>

<p>Check out Ben&#8217;s post for more head-nodding features I would love to see in the future of RSS.</p>
