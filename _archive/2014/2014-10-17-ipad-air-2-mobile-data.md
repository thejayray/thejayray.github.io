<blockquote>
  <p>The new Apple SIM is preinstalled on iPad Air 2 with Wi-Fi   Cellular models. The Apple SIM gives you the flexibility to choose from a variety of short-term plans from select carriers in the U.S. and UK right on your iPad. So whenever you need it, you can choose the plan that works best for you â€” with no long-term commitments. And when you travel, you may also be able to choose a data plan from a local carrier for the duration of your trip.</p>

<p>Under the title, &#8220;One SIM, Many Options&#8221;, on the iPad Air 2 marketing page about the wireless technology in the new model, Apple discusses the most underrated of the updates to its new tablet. <a href="http://www.macstories.net/linked/new-ipads-and-the-apple-sim/">MacStories</a> founder, <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/522924965973467136">Federico Viticci</a>, linked to an old rumor at <a href="https://gigaom.com/2010/10/27/is-apple-about-to-cut-out-the-carriers/">GigaOM</a> in 2010 that discussed a SIM card that could be integrated directly into the iPhone and connect to any carrier the user wanted, as long as access was authorized by the network. That is essentially what the new iPad Air 2 can do and that is fantastic news for the consumer and possibly terrible news for the mobile network providers, especially Verizon, who <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/10/16/apple-sim">seems</a> to have opted out of the partnership, whether by choice or otherwise.</p>
