<p>Andy Ihnatko said something in this week&#8217;s episode of MacVoices that really got me thinking about my life as a technologist. The episode, linked to above, focused on the Apple Watch and similar smartwatches on the market.</p>

<p>Starting at 43:42 of the episode, Mr. Ihnatko starts talking about explaining technology to those that don&#8217;t understand it or have never used it. Here&#8217;s the best part, in my opinion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The other analogy is the comparison to Graphical User Interfaces&#8230; You don&#8217;t realize how bad you had it until you get to try something different from [what you are used to].</p>
  
  <p>-Andy Ihnatko, 45:11, MacVoices #14204: Adam Engst, Andy Ihnatko and Jason Snell on The Pebble and the Smartwatch Future</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find that this resonated with me because I was the person in my family and group of friends who was considered an early adopter and the question is always, &#8220;You have X, why do you need Y?&#8221; This question will undoubtedly come up again with the discussion of smartwatches. Why do you need a smartwatch when you have a phone, fitness tracker, normal watch, etc.? My answer is always contingent on the person asking the question understanding the capabilities of the device in question and/or the intricacies of the greater technological landscape in which this device finds itself.</p>

<p>Moving forward, my answer for technologies in their mass market infancy should probably be, &#8220;I&#8217;ll let you know when I have one.&#8221;</p>
