<blockquote>
  <p>The Bike Design Project is an independent innovation platform for the urban utility bike. We’ve partnered high-level design firms with American bicycle craftsmen to collaboratively develop the next-wave urban bike. Five teams from five cycling-centric cities are competing to concept, create and champion their unique vision of tomorrow’s bicycle for the everyday rider. The results will redefine the category and have the potential to reshape urban mobility itself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This competition is about creating a bike that you’ll want to ride daily, so you’re choosing the winner.  Everyone gets a vote – pick the bike you want to see go from concept and design to retail availability.</p>
