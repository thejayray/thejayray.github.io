<p>I did the math <a href="https://twitter.com/JayRay/status/473840212473548802" title="@JayRay - Twitter">weeks</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/JayRay/status/473840836216901632" title="@JayRay - Twitter">ago</a> and found that Apple&#8217;s pricing for iCloud Drive is very competitive, especially for a service that should be more seamless in terms of its use across my devices. CNET has a good list of the competition, even if the services technically provide different purposes at times.</p>
