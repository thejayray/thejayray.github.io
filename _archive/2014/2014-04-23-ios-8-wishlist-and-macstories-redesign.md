<p>MacStories, a tech blog by Federico Viticci, presented a redesign today that looks great, mainly because I love minimalism. Congratulations to him and his team for a job well done on the design. This morning, I noticed an updated Twitter icon and wondered what was up; well, now I have my answer. The redesign was discussed <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/welcome-to-macstories-4-0/" title="Welcome To MacStories 4.0 - MacStories">here</a>.</p>

<p>In pure Viticci form, the first non-introductory post on the new design (and the one that is attached to this page) was a <em>very</em> long iOS 8 Wishlist post. As I read through it, I was overcome with a sense of just how much Apple could do to improve iOS 7. The reality is that Apple has had a lot of difficulty creating both new features and stable releases simultaneously. Recently, I came across a tweet that I unfortunately neglected to keep (and we all know what it is like to search Twitter) that said it best: I hope that iOS 8 is boring, a stability release, a back-to-the-basics-of-what-makes-Apple-software-(generally)-great release. Basically every item on Viticci&#8217;s list would be great to see in iOS 8, but part of me really just wants the return of a focused Apple.</p>
