<blockquote>
<p>I see the war on Christmas in the reduction of SNAP benefits to millions of families, maintaining the status quo of hunger. I see the war on Christmas in the fight against the Affordable Care Act, maintaining the status quo of sickness. I see the war on Christmas in the systematic destruction of Public Housing in Chicago, maintaining the status quo of housing insecurity and homelessness. I see the war on Christmas in the battles against raising the minimum wage, maintaining the status quo of poverty. I see the war on Christmas in “get tough on crime” policies that incarcerate Americans at unprecedented rates and in the denial of basic rights to those who have been imprisoned and “paid their debt to society.” I see the war on Christmas in the break up of families through deportation and the unwillingness to fix a broken immigration policy. I see the war on Christmas in the continued drumbeats of those who call for the use of lethal force and war to bring peace to the earth.</p>

<p>Being the last day of &#8220;the 12 Days of Christmas&#8221; today, I thought we should revisit some poignant points regarding what Christmas should stand for and what the world has lost by glossing over Advent and the holiday season with consumerism.</p>
