<blockquote>
  <p>But just like most people don’t buy Windows computers from a Microsoft Store, most people don’t buy Android phones from Google. For the majority of Windows and Android users, the user experience comes pre-cluttered with a confusing cacophony of attempts to steal your eyeballs. And, since those two platforms are used by more people than Apple’s, that means most of the people in the world go through their desktop and mobile computing lives like this.</p>
  
  <p>Isn’t that sad? Self-destructive behavior usually is.</p>
