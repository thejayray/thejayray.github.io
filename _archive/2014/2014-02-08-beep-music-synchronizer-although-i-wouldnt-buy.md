<p>Although I wouldn&#8217;t buy <a href="https://www.thisisbeep.com/" title="Beep">this particular technology</a> due to a lack of personal need, it is a cool—if expensive—idea and I had to share the video. As you will see, the video is one that offers information about the product with a story to tell in a feel-good way and it does it more effectively than some multi-billion dollar companies can. Enjoy!</p>
