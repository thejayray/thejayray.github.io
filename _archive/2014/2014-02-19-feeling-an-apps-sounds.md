<blockquote>
<p>You see, with the Era in-ear and tethered to my phone, any sounds that would normally go through the speaker of the phone go right to the device. So I no longer feel bad about leaving the sound on. And now that means I get to hear not only push notification sounds, but <em>all</em> sounds being put to clever usage within apps. And some of them really do alter the way an app <em>feels</em>.</p>

<p>To some of you, this will be the most obvious thing in the world. But I know a lot of people are like myself and almost always have their phones set to silent. And weâ€™re all missing a big component of many apps and the overall mobile experience.</p>

<p>Although the general point of the post is not what the above portion suggests, I wanted to comment on the fact that sounds really do make or break an app in my mind. I have a couple of apps that use the generic sounds of the iPhone and I feel cheated when I hear the notifications. When there are apps the likes of Tweetbot and Letterpress that took the time to create sounds that truly fit their apps, any app that doesn&#8217;t take that extra time, as MG seems to agree, simply <em>feels</em> inferior.</p>
