>I'm pleased to introduce the all-new NextDraft splash page and site. It was designed by the talented Bryan Bell and coded by the noted Wordpress wrangler Andrew Norcross. As an indie publisher, I rely on people like Andrew and Bryan to take this publication seriously, and on the generous support of Wordpress dot com to keep the gears of my modern day printing press (and my palms) well-greased. I also depend readers like you to help spread the word. So check out the new digs and share the hell out of it.

After reading this, I was compelled to "share the hell out of it." I love the recent app and website refreshes and, of course, the daily (somewhat comedic) round up of news. Thanks, Dave!
