The MiniPresso reminds me of the Aeropress in a lot of ways, but in a sleeker and easier-to-travel-with package. Simple and perfect video, too.

I find it funny that my first thought upon watching this video was, "This is the future!" \**Put on geek glasses** As if a human-powered pneumatic pump is a mind-blowing idea.
