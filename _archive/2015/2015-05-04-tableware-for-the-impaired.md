Eatwell is a Indiegogo project that is astoundingly interesting; a set of dishware specifically created for those with cognitive impairment, based on research and studies about appetite and interest. 

My grandmother had dementia before she died and one of the hardest things to deal with was her lack of appetite towards the end, especially given its direct correlation to her lack of strength and inability to fight off infections. My mother was her caregiver for a long time and works in Chicago Public Schools working with cognitively impaired high school students.

Perhaps I will discuss this solution with her and update this post with her views soon. In the meantime, consider backing the campaign.
