>Muting Siri with the hardware switch is an easy setting to turn on, but it’s a bit buried and worded a little strange, so don’t be surprised if you overlooked it when wandering around in Settings.

Even I had no idea and I purposefully look for settings of this nature; also, why is this not the default setting? Seems like a no brainer. Another little known but necessary tip with regard to Siri is how to control her volume. The user actually has to call her up and then use the volume rocker to turn her up or down; use that and say goodbye to ridiculously loud and annoyingly conspicuous Siri. I'm not even sure why she has her own volume setting, to by honest.

Now, if only I could communicate with Siri without actually talking out loud.
