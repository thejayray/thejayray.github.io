I don't normally get involved in GamerGate discussions, but I was compelled by Brianna Wu's words. As a relatively recent father to a beautiful girl, I am terrified about a future where she is marginalized, threatened, and seen as less important than male counterparts (who will more than likely not be able to keep up with her intellectually). She is already showing her intelligence in engineering and problem solving at fifteen months; Lexi and I will continue to cultivate that curiosity and passion with the hope that the future will give her more of a shot than the present has given Brianna Wu, Zoe Quinn, Anita Sarkeesian, and all the other women who don't have a strong enough following to be heard.
