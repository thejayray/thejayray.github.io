I finally got around to reading Dr. Drang’s [coverage of Lagrange points](http://leancrew.com/all-this/2015/08/satellite-of-love/) and its interest in the case of the satellite that took this picture/gif:

To be completely honest, it took me back to college and my mechanical engineering degree. I realize sometimes, that I miss that portion of my education dreadfully; it is what made me who I am today because it taught me to stay interested in learning and being challenged. Here’s a taste:

>Lagrange is a name you’ll become very familiar with if you do any work in mechanics. He was a 18th century mathematician/astronomer/whatever who took Newton’s mechanics, which was based on forces, and reformulated it in terms of potential and kinetic energy. I spent one semester in grad school where it seemed like all I did was generate differential equations of vibrating systems using Lagrange’s equations.
