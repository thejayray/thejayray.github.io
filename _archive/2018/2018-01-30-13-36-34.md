tweet: Quote of my day from MG Seigler's Happy Hour Newsletter: "What used to be my job is now just a hobby."

title: My Hobby

> I know that eventually I’m going to break down and get one. Because I like to test new technology products. And I honestly think these days I like to do that because I like to write about testing new technology products. What used to be my job is now just a hobby – but writing continues to help me frame my thoughts on things. And I still consider voice to be an aspect of technology that is at an early, but crucial juncture. And I continue to believe Apple is blowing it with their HomePod strategy.
