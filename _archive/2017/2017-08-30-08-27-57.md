> 
> - We don't track individual users in any way.
> - Our server logs weather forecast requests, but these aren't associated with a specific person. (In other words, we don't know who sent the request — only that a request occurred.)
> - With each request, we also log which version of the app and which OS version was used to make the request, so we can make sure you're getting the correct stuff for your version.
> - All logs are deleted from the server after 1-2 days.
