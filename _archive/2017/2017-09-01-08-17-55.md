>August was a challenge. I completed a full 5-day water only fast. The first time I've attempted such a feat. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done. The hunger subsides, but the disrupted sleep (tossing and turning all night) was brutal. Why do this? [Check out Dr. Rhonda Patrick's interview w/ Dr. Longo](http://email.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=63d79e017888d9e2fed9be2aa&id=0908936f16&e=9c9c1680fe) for more details on the benefits of 5-day fasting. (Note: always consult your doctor before attempting any fast.)
