>This lot comes to us from the highest reaches of breathtaking Finca San Sebastian in San Miguel Dueñas, Guatemala. We call it Ring of Fire because sitting at around 2000 masl, this coffee was grown in one of the highest altitude areas in the region—making it incredibly unique. In a cup of Ring of Fire, you’ll taste the results of high-altitude growth. You’ll notice a sweet lemonade-like acidity complimented by a pleasant, honeydew melon-like body and cocoa finish.
