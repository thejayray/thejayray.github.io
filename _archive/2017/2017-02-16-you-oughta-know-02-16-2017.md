## Flynn
There is too much to cover to summarize the Flynn debacle in a few words (or a few paragraphs), but I wanted to link to some of the resources in chronological order I have come across to explain the crumbling of the current administration. (And make no mistake, this situation is a big deal and could amount to treason charges for Flynn and impeachment inquiries.)

## Awesome Woman of the Day
“In 1947, Dr. Marie M. Daly earned a Ph.D. in chemistry making her the first African-American woman in the United States to do so.” -[NAACP, @NAACP - Twitter][18]

Some fun facts about Dr. Daly:
+ She received her doctorate from Columbia University.
