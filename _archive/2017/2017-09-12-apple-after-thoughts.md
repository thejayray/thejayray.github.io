The following paragraphs are a repost of an earlier microblog context.

I always attempt to digest Apple events before reporting out on them in any way, but I have to say that it was an odd one. I think all of the updates announced were solid, but I just don’t know that I will be capitalizing on any of the announcements right at launch. In contrast, previous upgrade cycles have felt like no-brainers.

I have an iPhone 7 on the iPhone Upgrade Program and I have been happy with this model. The iPhone 8 doesn’t appear to be that big of an update for me and the iPhone X is, as expected, more expensive.
