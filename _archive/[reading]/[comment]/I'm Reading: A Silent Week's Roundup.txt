title: I'm Reading: A Silent Week's Roundup
---

I have been radio silent this week, but I have read a lot. A few of the highlights include the lifting of the embargo on Apple's new tech updates (MacBook Air and Mac Mini), commentary on the "Pro" in iPad Pro, choosing a markdown editor in a crowded field of awesome options, and thought pieces on minimalism, voting, and the use of humans over machines in the news industry. In the interest of your time, I have only included pull quotes where necessary, otherwise the links are a simply bulleted list with context. The articles are listed by topic in no particular order.

## The iPad
Craig Mod has one of the most well thought out commentaries I have seen recently about the state of professional workflows on the iPad. I both enjoyed the read and continued my own processing of my workflows from Mac to iPad.

> You can argue that camera makers should have more seamless updates — maybe through connecting the camera to a network, checksuming the files, digitally signing, securely downloading and installing the firmware themselves. But you can also very reasonably argue that the United States should be using metric measurements. It doesn’t mean it will happen.

The main reason why I am linking to a Laptop Magazine review of the iPad Pro is because of the production quality of the video review.

Shocker, Ben doesn't like some things about the new Smart Keyboard Folio. But seriously, he makes some really good points, especially when discussing the price.

I am linking to Marco Arment's video review of the new iPad Pro because his video reviews of late are beginning to be watchable. The most unique this about this review is Marco's ability to compare the two sizes of iPad Pro side-by-side since he was given a review unit (12.9") and purchased the 11" model.

## Miscellany
MacStories breaks down the pros and cons of two fantastic Markdown Editors, both of which I use. If you are in the market for a Notes replacement or new text editor of any kind on iOS, read this rundown.

Steven Sinofsky (a former President at Microsoft's Windows Division) runs down the history of naysayers when new technologies take over old workflows. Fun thread.

I have had this article in my thread for awhile; it makes me want to use Apple News even more.
+ [Apple News’s Radical Approach: Humans Over Machines - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/apple-news-humans-algorithms.html)
> In a quiet corner of the third floor, Apple is building a newsroom of sorts. About a dozen former journalists have filled a few nondescript offices to do what many other tech companies have for years left to software: selecting the news that tens of millions of people will read.

I think a lot about minimalism, but I had a recent conversation that made be realize I am a minimalist for a different reason that I will have to expound upon later: If I am not actively using something, I want someone else to have the opportunity. Though my approach to minimalism may be more about sharing wealth, this article has some good thoughts on why minimalism is becoming more popular.

> At its core, minimalism is living with intentionality; it is simplifying life down to the bare essentials, instead focusing on nonmaterial aspects such as health, happiness and relationships. In minimalism, less truly is more.

I wasn't even alive when Roger Angell first voted, but his commentary is important about the civic duty that all citizens share; we should all take pride in our ability to change the face of our country with our vote. Unfortunately, we break records when we get 50% of people to show up.

I don't really care about Apple's finances, but there are always interesting gems in these types of break downs. Best bit below.
+ [Daring Fireball: Apple’s Q4 2018 Results](https://daringfireball.net/2018/11/aapl_q4_results)
> This stinks as an observer of the company, but I don’t find it at all surprising. None of Apple’s competitors release unit sale numbers for phones, tablets, or PCs. I think it’s more surprising that it took Apple so long to make this change. Secretive company decides to be more secretive — news at 11.

## The Mac Mini
I toyed with not linking out to review posts at all. They are say about the same thing and generally speaking they are positive reviews all around.

+ [The 2018 Mac Mini – Marco.org](https://marco.org/2018/11/06/mac-mini-2018-review)

## The MacBook Air
As with the Mac Mini, I thought about not linking to these at all, but they are informative and shed some light on Apple's moves in their laptop line, especially as Intel drops the ball on being competitive with Apple's own A-Series chip options. Daring Fireball's review goes into detail about benchmarks between this MacBook Air and the recently reviewed iPad Pro; the numbers do not shine well on Intel.
