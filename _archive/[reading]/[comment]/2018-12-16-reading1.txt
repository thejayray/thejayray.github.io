From [So Long, Step Count: My Brief and Sad Smartwatch Hiatus - WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/rants-and-raves-my-smartwatch-hiatus/):

> Sometimes our relationships with our things don't always make sense. We like some things because even if they require more care and attention than they ever return, you once received that important text message on your wrist at a moment when you really couldn’t look at your phone. We like them because sometime companies over-engineer a feature on a product, and you at least respect the effort. We like them because they’re attached to us, and as a result, we become attached to them.

And sometimes our relationships with our things can be unhealthy.
