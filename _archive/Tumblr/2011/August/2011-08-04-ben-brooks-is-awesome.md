Ben Brooks, over at his blog, The Brooks Review, has run a couple articles that have made my day:

[Buyer’s Remorse Over Windows](http://brooksreview.net/2011/08/buyers-remorse/ "Buyer's Remorse Over Windows") and [It Gets More Idiotic](http://brooksreview.net/2011/08/follow-up-idiot/ "Permanent Link to It Gets More Idiotic")

These posts follow a new and seemingly suspecting (read: knowing) Windows buyer who has chosen a strange path to say the least: sticking with the PC after a horrible time over the first few days. You will have to read the saga via the above links and I hope there is more to come to be honest because I would love to see Ben’s reaction to more idiocy, but I have one comment.

As an IT guy, a Mac guy, and a frugal person all in one, I have a hard time believing that the reason why Ms. Oricchio would buy a Windows machine is due to frugality; don’t give us frugal people a bad name! I believe her motives to be more about naiveté than simply being cheap (especially since she seems to have no intention of taking the computer back). I can be downright stingy some times, but I see the value in the upfront purchase price of a Mac (not to mention the ridiculous resale value). Maybe the sentiment is that I am simply more interested in paying money upfront for a better user experience, which is of more value to me long term.
