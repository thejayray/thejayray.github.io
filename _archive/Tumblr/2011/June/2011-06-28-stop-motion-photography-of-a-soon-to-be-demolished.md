title: Stop motion photography of a soon-to-be-demolished automotive factory&hellip; Beautiful shots.

This footage, shot with a Nikon D90 and Canon 5D, was taken at the  oldest motor factory in the world. Founded in 1864, it saw the likes of  Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach walk its halls.
Now these ruins await demolition to be replaced by a cable factory. Still beautiful. [NOTCOT]
