> Ultimately, perhaps companies need to re-evaluate their use of the Web itself. If a company really does need to perform extensive validation and verification of its software, perhaps using a browser to deliver that software just isn’t appropriate. There are platforms that have a slower pace of evolution, stabler APIs, greater resistance to feature regressions, and long-term support: they’re called operating systems. If long-term stability is what you want, perhaps a desktop application is what you need.
