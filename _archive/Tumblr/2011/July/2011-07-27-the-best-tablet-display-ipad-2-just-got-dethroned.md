I can understand that the iPad 2’s display has been nudged out of first place by the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1’s in a number of tests done by DisplayMate, but when I look at the battery tests, my heart hurts. What is the point of a great screen if you can only get 5 hours of battery life out of it at full brightness? The answer is especially important when discussing the fact that for the same test the iPad 2 gets 8 hours, and the Tab’s screen quality beats the iPad’s “by a nose” only.
