> Still, the effect of a popular product’s grammatical branding on the way children write is an interesting side effect – and one which is not limited solely to Apple’s influence. Think of all the Web 2.0 names, like Flickr, Digg and Topix, which are nothing more than misspelled real words. Again, I’m not suggesting those brand names should change, but that being said, if children start spelling “flower” like “flowr,” I’m gonna personally launch a war to bring back the vowels.
