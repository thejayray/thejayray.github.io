title: Gruber on Flash FMS 4.5

I have been preaching this message since I built my first CDN (!!!) (content distribution network):

> This is the wrong approach for video publishers to take, though. They should be sending HTML5/H.264 video to any user agent that supports it, and only falling back to Flash Player for user agents that donâ€™t support HTML5 and H.264\. Flash Player should be the fallback exception, not the other way around. E.g., a factory-fresh Mac running Safari could be supported the same way iOS devices are, but instead, FMS will insist on using Flash Player, and instead of being shown video, the user will be told to go install Flash Player.
