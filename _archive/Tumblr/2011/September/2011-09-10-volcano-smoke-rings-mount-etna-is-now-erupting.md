title: Volcano Smoke Rings!
---

Mount Etna is now erupting in Italy, spewing hot lava everywhere. Back in 2000, Etna was much calmer. She spent her days chilling out, blowing pretty smoke rings, which is apparently an extremely rare occurrence for volcanoes.
So strange, in fact, that only three have been documented: Two from Etna in 1970 and 2000, and another from Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland, in May 2010. I like to think the Devil is sitting inside, having some brandy and a cigar.
