> The survey of 2,000 mobile phone owners yields some noteworthy numbers. Men are more likely to notice their mobile phone missing in less than 15 minutes than women—40 percent of men compared to 29 percent of women. I’m not sure if the researchers delved any deeper, but my own theory is that it might be a function of purses. My smartphone is always in my front left pocket and I can easily tell if it’s there or not. My wife’s smartphone is in her purse, and there is a 50-50 chance at best of finding the thing in there even if you try—so she is much less likely to realize if it’s lost or stolen.

So true!
