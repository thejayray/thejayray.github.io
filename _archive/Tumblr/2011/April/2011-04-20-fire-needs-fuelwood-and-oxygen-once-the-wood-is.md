title: 40 Days Without Violence, Day 37
---

> Fire needs fuel–wood and oxygen. Once the wood is gone, the fire burns itself out. Once the oxygen is gone, the fire cannot sustain itself. The servant’s silence sucks the oxygen out of the room. There is no fuel for the fire. How often we add fuel to the fire by our reactions and responses–the timely insult, the sarcastic barb, the witty comeback, the punch in the face. Our response only justifies more aggression. Silence has the power to extinguish the violence.
