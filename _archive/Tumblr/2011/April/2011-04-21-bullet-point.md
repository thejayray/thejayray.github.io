This is a explanation of the state of the mobile competitive landscape. I complain about my Android phone’s battery life all the time and have been astounded about just how good the iPad’s battery life is. This is probably why Apple touts this information as much as it does.

> I think the new plateau, the new bullet point, is becoming battery life. Notebook manufacturers, tablet manufacturers and phone manufacturers want to build and sell devices that have a battery that will last all day with continuous use. I want that too. I think we all do.
