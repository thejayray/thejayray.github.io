I am planning to write a little exposition on the Amazon Android store since it is a new idea and they are already going to get more people to actually purchase content on Android; as it is, Angry Birds is a paid app on Amazon and still free in the Google Market.  Angry Birds Rio is exclusive for Android on Amazon’s store!  It may be a rocky start, but this is not something that Amazon will be willing to just let go.
