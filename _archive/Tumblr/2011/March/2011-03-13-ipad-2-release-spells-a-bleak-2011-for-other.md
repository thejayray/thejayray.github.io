Yet again, Andy Ihnatko brings his wit and foresight to bear with a great analysis of how to beat the iPad.  I also enjoy reading the good that is left of the Chicago news segment.  My hope is that the iPad _will_ be challenged because it will be good for innovation and the consumer in the long run.
