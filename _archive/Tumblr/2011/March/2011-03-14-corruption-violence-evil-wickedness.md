title: 40 Days of Violence, Day 5
---

> Corruption, violence, evil, wickedness, oppression. Sounds like a description of Chicago. It is actually a description of the world of Noah’s day (Genesis 6:5ff). God’s response? Regret and a deeply troubled heart; and a decision to hit the reset button. Makes me wonder what God is feeling toward 21st century conditions of oppression, aggression, political and moral corruption, systemic injustice. God’s finger IS on the reset button. Oppression and violence does not have the final word. God has promised a new creation that will come, not through the annihilation of humanity by water, but through the transformation of humanity by the water and the blood. God has said, “I will make all things new.” And in Christ, the reset button has been pressed.
