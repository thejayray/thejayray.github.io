Congrats to Michael Doyle. Read the full post!

> The very first book I read during my conversion studies–[_Why Be Jewish?_](http://www.amazon.com/Why-Be-Jewish-David-Wolpe/dp/0805039279) by David J. Wolpe–suggested an answer to societal demands that we take our spiritual lives lightly: why? Of all things ever to take seriously, why not take seriously questions like why are we here? How are we here? What else may exist in All That Is? Why not give extra weight to things like love, compassion, joy, justice? Going against the grain like that requires bravey, but in the end, we’re responsible for our own lives and our own hearts.
