From my gofobo review of Adam Sandler’s new movie, **That’s My Boy**:

> Adam Sandler’s new movie, That’s My Boy, had the entire theater laughing at a special screening in Indianapolis on Tuesday, but it was mostly uncomfortable. Bringing up such uncomfortable topics in humor as adultery, incest, teacher-student molestation, fat naked chicks, old naked chicks, and much more, the over-the-top movie was an Adam Sandler flick through and through, so plan accordingly. Aside from the old hat Adam Sandler, however, there was the addition of Andy Samberg’s special type of comedy that is more subtle, which meant that the film had a strange combinatory rhythm to it that I couldn’t follow. Often, while the crowd was laughing about the gross out jokes, Samberg’s sarcastic remarks in retort were completely lost in the shuffle. Also, Adam Sandler has a voice that he puts on that is a mix of Good Will Hunting’s Southie and Tollbooth Willy’s slightly slurred drunk speak. I suppose since Sandler’s character was constantly drinking, this was due to his actually being drunk.
