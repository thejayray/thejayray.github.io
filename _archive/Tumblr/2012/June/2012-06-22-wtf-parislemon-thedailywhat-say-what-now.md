There are several parallels, such as elves, dwarfs, wizards, goblins, trolls, magic (especially invisibility), etc. Sauron is referred to as “Dark Lord” just like Voldemort is. There is also the elder white-haired bearded wizard who serves as a mentor, Gandalf, who is reminiscent of Dumbledore. Some of the character names are similar, such as Wormtongue as opposed to Wormtail, too. There is even a gigantic spider (Shelob) at the end of “The Two Towers” that reminds one of Aragog from _Chamber of Secrets_. I even noticed that the plots of both series begin with the protagonists’ birthday. Now I see that Tolkien, this unoriginal bastard, is coming out with _The Hobbit_ in December. This would be fine, but why didn’t he just write this book first to begin with? I still like Lord of the Rings, though–don’t get me wrong–but I wonder if Tolkien has ever said in interviews whether he borrowed elements from _Harry Potter_. I’ll be watching the extended DVDs later this week and I think he’s featured on the commentary track, so I look forward to that.

> This is awesome. But honestly, I’ve always been curious why more people don’t accuse _Harry Potter_ of being a _Lord of the Rings_ rip. Don’t get me wrong, I like _Harry Potter_ just fine and the later books get better and do diverge, but come on…
