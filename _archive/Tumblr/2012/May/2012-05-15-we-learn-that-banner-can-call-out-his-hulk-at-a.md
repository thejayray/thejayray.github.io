> WE LEARN THAT BANNER CAN CALL OUT HIS HULK AT A MOMENT’S NOTICE. WHICH, IN THIS HULK’S OPINION, IS A WONDERFUL EVOLUTION OF THE CHARACTER. IT SPEAKS TO THE IDEA THAT OUR EMOTIONS ARE SOMETHING THAT ALWAYS PRESENT. ANGER CAN’T BE ABSTAINED FROM. IT CANNOT BE FEARED. ANGER IS SIMPLY AN EVER-PRESENT PART OF US, JUST AS MUCH AS JOY, SADNESS, OR EVEN SOMETHING INSTINCTUAL LIKE HUNGER. IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS JUST FELT.
