I finished reading this marathon review of Apple’s new operating system over the weekend; the below quote is one of the gems from Siracusa’s 26,000 word article.

On for whom Mountain Lion was created:

> “The fact is, we are not the center of the market, and haven’t been for a long time. Three decades ago, the personal computer industry was built on the backs of technology enthusiasts. Every product, every ad was created to please us. No longer. Technology must now work for everyone, not just ‘computing enthusiasts.’”
