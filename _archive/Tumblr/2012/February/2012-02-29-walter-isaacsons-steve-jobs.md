title: Walter Isaacson’s ‘Steve Jobs’

There is no single quote that portray’s this review of the Steve Jobs book in its entirety, so you should read the whole thing. Here is a taste:

> Isaacson’s book may well be the defining resource for Jobs’s personal life — his childhood, youth, eccentricities, cruelty, temper, and emotional outbursts. But as regards Jobs’s work, Isaacson leaves the reader profoundly and tragically misinformed.

and

> What we need is the story of the one man who spearheaded so many remarkable products and who built an amazing and unique company.

These quotes show well why I have refrained in part from reading the bio. From everything I have read about the book, as an Apple enthusiast and technologically informed person, there is no way that this book is for a person like me. I have also been told of other books on the horizon that will be more technical and true-to-form, like Jobs would have preferred. At that time, I will write on the book that I read with a, hopefully, satiated appetite for such matters.
