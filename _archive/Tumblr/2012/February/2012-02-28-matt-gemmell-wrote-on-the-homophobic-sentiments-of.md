Matt Gemmell wrote on the homophobic sentiments of the Pope and how it reflects badly on religion in general:

> You simply cannot reconcile a mandate to love one’s neighbour, whilst then adding a list of openly bigoted exceptions. The only possible result is a crumbling, or an implosion. Sadly, it’s often of the person, rather than the faith which is to blame.

As an open-minded intellectual, I hate the idea that people like Matt and his friend suffer in the face of a church that should stand for tolerance and love for all people. This Lenten season, all Christians should take note of those who are persecuted around them and pray daily for their deliverance from a world that cannot provide peace and understanding to all. Matt, and your physicist friend, I pray that both of you will find what it is you need in this world and in your daily lives you see those Christians around you fighting for a better world.
