title: Fuel Cells and Bloom Energy

> The critic that CBS trotted out on 60 Minutes, Green Tech Media’s Michael Kanellos, says that while there’s a 20 percent chance we’ll have a fuel cell box in our basements in 10 years, but “it’s going to say GE.” Which is fine with me, actually, because that means another season of 30 Rock jokes.
