To all who follow me,

I wanted to announce today that my blogspot site will now redirect here, to my tumblog.  I have worked with both sites now since I started with idea to have a blog at all.  I have been dual posting.  If anyone has ever tried that tactic, it’s difficult.  Now with the inception of Google Buzz, there is just one more place that I will need to keep track of things.  So I decided to take the plunge and take the extra work that is the blogspot site off my plate.  I have been working on a few pieces for a dual post, but look no further than this Tumblog.  Thank you for following and I hope you continue.  Thank you.

The Jay Ray
