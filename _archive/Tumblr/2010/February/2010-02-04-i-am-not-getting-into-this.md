title: I am not getting into this...
---

While thinking up my next post, I can be quoted as saying that I would discuss a number of things: “Flash v. HTML5, the iPad, iPhone v. Android” (now that I actually own an iPhone), as well as a few others.  However, after reading and rereading articles and blogs about the iPad, after watching the keynote twice, after contemplating the place where the iPad would really fit into my day-to-day life, I now realize I’m not going to get into this…  I am not going to add to the cannon fodder of either argument.  Whether or not I think the iPad is the “best technology in a magical & revolutionary device at an unbelievable price” or not is somewhat irrelevant to how the device will progress over time.  I will say this in closing: I personally think that the conversations we have now will be moot when the iPad, either in its current or later iterations, is released on the world, not because it is revolutionary or magical, but because it appeals to those that will never read this sentence.
