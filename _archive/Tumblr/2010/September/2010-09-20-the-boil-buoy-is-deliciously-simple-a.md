The Boil Buoy is deliciously simple. A miniaturized buoy that floats inside your pot, jingling its bells when the agitated seas begin to boil. You hear the bell, you know it&rsquo;s time to cook. Or, you could just stand there and stare at the pot. Like some kind of non-lazy chump. (via A Watched Pot Never Boils, But a Whistling One Does)
