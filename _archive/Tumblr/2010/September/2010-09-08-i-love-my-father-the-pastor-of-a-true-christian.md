I normally do not send emails that address current events/issues.  However, the decision of a church/pastor in Florida to burn the Koran on the anniversary of 9/11 seemed too important.  I’m sure you all are concerned about the implications for the perception of Christianity by Muslims and for the safety of our Christian brothers and sisters around the world–especially those in predominately Islamic countries like Pakistan–who are sure to become targets of rage.  

What this Florida church has planned is NOT Christian.  As Christians, we follow Jesus’ command to love our neighbor as ourselves, love our enemy, to do good to those who mistreat us and to bless those who curse us. There is nothing loving about burning the Koran.  Please pray.
