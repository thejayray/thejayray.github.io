> I can’t tell whether Geschke is being dishonest, or whether he truly is under the impression that Mac users don’t have serious, long-standing complaints about the quality and UI design of Photoshop (and the entire CS suite). And Acrobat? Acrobat is despised by Mac users. If not for Apple’s Preview (and Mac OS X’s Apple-written PDF implementation), Mac users would despise the entire PDF format.
