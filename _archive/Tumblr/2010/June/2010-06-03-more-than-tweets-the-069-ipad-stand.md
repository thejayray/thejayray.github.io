> Bought a wireless keyboard today to eventually replace the [iPad Keyboard Dock](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC533LL/A?fnode=MTc0MjU4NjE&mco=MTc0MjYxNjM) I ordered online with my iPad. One really should try out a product before buying peripherals. But what I was really looking for was a stand that kept my iPad upright in either landscape or portrait. Neither the Keyboard Dock nor the [iDock](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MC360ZM/A?fnode=MTc0MjU4NjE&mco=MTc0MjU5Nzk) does this… granted, those do charge the iPad while docked. And I saw [Griffin’s A-Frame: Tabletop Stand for iPad](http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/a-frame) in stock at the Apple Store. But at $49… it’s ridiculously expensive.

> Then I went to [Office Depot](http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/886149/Office-Depot-Business-Card-Holder-Black/) and found this: [Business Card Holder](http://www.flickr.com/photos/drewvigal/sets/72157623703596169/) for $0.69.
