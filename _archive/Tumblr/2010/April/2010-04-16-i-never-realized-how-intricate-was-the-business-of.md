“The ability to decipher Apple’s serial number code to ascertain when a given machine was produced has been used by many customers wishing to learn more about the age of their machines, particularly when it comes to production issues. Understanding whether production date makes a difference in whether machines do or do not suffer from a given issue can help pinpoint when fixes might have been deployed and either alert or reassure customers attempting to determine whether their machines might be affected.” (via [Apple Tweaks Serial Number Format With New MacBook Pro - Mac Rumors](http://www.macrumors.com/2010/04/16/apple-tweaks-serial-number-format-with-new-macbook-pro/))
