title: The US in NOT #1 in Broadband
---

> According to people like Ivan Seidenberg, Verizon’s CEO, the US is number one in broadband, no question about it. But one only has to look around the world to see just how specious such claims are.  
>   
> Take Hong Kong as an example. City Telecom made waves a few months ago with its US$13, symmetric 100Mbps connections. Today, the company slashed prices on its much faster 1Gbps fiber-to-the-home offering; a fully symmetric, 1Gbps connection costs HK$199… or US$26 a month.
> 
> Want phone service with that? That’ll be US$3\. IPTV service will cost another $6-12, depending on the channel package. (There’s also a US$115 installation charge to run the fiber link from the building basement up to an individual apartment.)
