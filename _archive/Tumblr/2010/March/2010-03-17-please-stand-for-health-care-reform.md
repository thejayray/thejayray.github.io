title: Please Stand for Health Care Reform
---

I don’t normally post things that deal with political issues, but I needed to share what my home church is saying and hope that you listen…

A vote on health care reform is likely to come before the House of Representatives by the end of the week.  46 million people in America have no health care.  Many more have inadequate coverage.  Even though the bill before congress is incomplete and includes some provisions that are objectionable, doing nothing is even more objectionable.  

Kimball Avenue Church has been a part of the Campaign for Better Health Care and believes that a Kingdom vision includes health (and health care).  Jesus said, “I was sick and you took care of me."  There are 46 million reasons why we must act.  

Please contact your representative and express your hope and expectation that health care reform will be passed.  Your action is yet another way that we can fulfill the intent of the Lenten Compact for Health and "address the stress” of lack of access to health care.  

This is not about republicans and democrats.  This is for the “least of these” of our sisters and brothers.  

Thank you for taking action.
