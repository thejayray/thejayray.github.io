title: Apple and Google
---

I like Apple and I like Google.  I use both and I am happy to state it in a public forum, such as this.  Another thing that I will admit is the fact that I like competition in the technological space because it is always better for the consumer.  However, what I do not like is competition to the point of stupidity, which is what I believe we are starting to see in the growing Apple/Google rivalry.

I just read John Gruber’s [“Hope You Like the Smell of Napalm in the Morning”](http://daringfireball.net/2010/03/napalm_in_the_morning "Daring Fireball") on Daring Fireball and it got me thinking that my silence on this particular subject is mainly due to the fact that I don’t know how to feel about the whole thing.  The fact that Apple and Google are at odds could be catastrophic for the way that I use the Internet and experience my otherwise technology-filled existence.  I want the two companies to compete, I want them both to grow and thrive, but I also want them both to grow up!  

I don’t want to get further into this sinkhole, this abyss of childish playground fighting except to say this: There tends to be a point in time when people (everyone one of us) needs to suck it up and work with people we don’t like.  To the betterment of the users, Apple and Google need to do exactly this.
