## Technologist, Advocate, and Leader

I am a passionate and conscientious technology professional with over 15 years of experience in the higher education technology field at various levels; a seasoned appreciation for the benefits of collaboration and diversity, equity, and inclusion; and an enthusiasm to explore opportunities to extend my leadership, while continuing to produce beneficial change wherever I am.

I have spent my career in higher education technology across the non-profit sector, proprietary education, and public and private institutions, specifically focusing on help desk support and management; computer lab operations and management; and infrastructure design and implementation. Since 2014, I have been serving as the Technology Operations Manager for the Libraries at University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I manage services across multiple campus libraries, spearheading initiatives to ensure that the libraries remain in sight of what students, faculty, staff, and partners on campus need and want out of their educational institution's library facilities.
