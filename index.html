<h2 id="about-the-site">About the Site</h2>
<p>Engineered Eloquence was born out of my desire to make a more concerted effort to document my thoughts and life. This is version 6 of the Engineered Eloquence site (no science went into that version number) and with it, I am working on a more focused, more professional site that I can look back on with pride ten years from now. <em>Although the entire archive of content exists on the site to ensure old links continue to work, only long-form posts are currently visible for click-through.</em></p>
<h2 id="about-the-design">About the Design</h2>
<p>This site runs on <a href="https://blot.im">Blot.im</a>, intentionally with minimal structure and code. I personally chose every aspect of the site with the below-listed items as noteworthy.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hover.com/5YQDknpW">Hover</a> for Domain Name and associated services</li>
<li>Heavily modified version of the <a href="https://blot.im/templates/essay">Essay template</a></li>
<li>Fonts used:
<ul>
<li>Norwester for Title</li>
<li>Kollektif for Headings</li>
<li>Montserrat for Body</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-relevant-history">Some Relevant History</h2>
<p>In 2009, I started using Tumblr as a blogging platform. Prior to that, I had a few side projects that helped me gain an understanding of web technologies, all the way back to a website run on Apple’s&nbsp;.Mac service using iWeb to build it.</p>
<p>The freedom of posting whatever I wanted to Tumblr with easy-to-use tools was the perfect way to get involved in the social media scene of the time. Looking back, I am astounded how little of what I wrote and shared matters to me now. However, I kept those posts, even transitioning them to my current site to allow for a record of my time on the web.</p>
<p>I have moved the site between providers multiple times and have been on Blot since 2015 due to simplicity and an ongoing developer relationship.</p>

<h2 id="support-the-site">Support the site</h2>
<p>I have never had ads on my websites, save for a short stint back in the late 2000s, when online ads were less intrusive and earned me basically nothing. I will continue to write and post, all without monetizing it, but if you want to support my writing, do so through PayPal here: <a href="https://paypal.me/engineeredeloquence">Engineered Eloquence</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading and taking this journey with me.</p>
