This article can speak for itself (it is short, you should just go read it), as can the video it details. My take-away: heart-wrenching and yet I can't stop watching it. To be frank, white people shouldn't stop watching it.

> "The truth is that this video, and what it suggests about its artist, is very difficult. A lot of black people hate it. Glover forces us to relive public traumas and barely gives us a second to breathe before he forces us to dance."
