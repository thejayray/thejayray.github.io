>In the case of the Neal/Neil’s, one could argue that they used expensive fountain pens, sure. But, my larger point it that writing is messy. It includes mistakes, errors, corrections, scratches, half-thoughts, and a lot of junk one must scribble over, cross out, and replace. You want tools — paper especially — you can get messy with. You want notebooks you don’t feel bad crossing entire pages out of or even ripping out a page and throwing it across the room in frustration.
