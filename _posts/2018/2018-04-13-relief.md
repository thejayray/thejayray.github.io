Tweet: Post length (among other things) used to be a thing that held me back from publishing; I’m trying to break that habit.

title: Relief

I wasn’t happy with yesterday’s post, but I published anyway. I’m trying to be better about hitting the button because historically I have not done a good job of doing so. In fact, rather often, in the pursuit of the perfect post, I would edit myself right out of posting anything at all.

When I was writing [*that* post about social media](/2018/04/that-post-about-social-media), my first thought was not about frequency of posts; I didn’t really think about whether that post would kickstart my writing habit again, but when I pressed the button that day, I felt relief. That sense of relief (at saying goodbye to "big social") and accomplishment (as if publishing caused the last piece of a puzzle to fall into place) was enough to remind me how important (cathartic, perhaps) sharing ones thoughts can be.
