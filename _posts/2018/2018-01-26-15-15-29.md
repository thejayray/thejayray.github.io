I follow The Rundown with Robin Thede ([Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/therundownbet)  or [BET](https://www.bet.com/shows/the-rundown-with-robin-thede.html)) and the podcast follow-up show The Randown ([iTunes Link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-randown-with-robin-thede/id1295851239?mt=2) or [BET](https://www.bet.com/shows/the-rundown-with-robin-thede/the-randown-podcast.html)) religiously these days and love both shows. The two-part coverage on afrofuturism is great and we need more coverage like it in the tech community. Check out the episodes via the links below and enjoy.
