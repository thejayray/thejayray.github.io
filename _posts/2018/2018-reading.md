## Completed:
+ **Raising a Modern Day Knight by Robert Lewis**
	+ This book was a Christmas gift. The only compelling thing about it in the end is the *idea* of Transendent Cause. Otherwise, the approach is hamfisted and misogynistic.
+ **1984 by George Orwell**
	+ Shortly after the 45th President was elected, 1984 became a hot commodity, required reading for all concerned citizens. While I agree that there are Orwellian tactics within 45’s repertoire, I am unsure (and will pray daily) that we will ever find ourselves in the distopia that Orwell so deftly crafts. Consider the following phrase when venturing into this book: *as depressing as real life*. For excerpts of note, see [here][1].
+ **A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'Engle**
	+ My wife's wonderful project-based learning middle school worked through this book with students and then saw the movie in the theatre. I haven't yet seen the movie (and I am ashamed), but the book was wonderful; I have been told that I should also be ashamed that it took me this long to read it. I also know that it is part of a series and will likely go on to read the rest at some point.
+ **Harry Potter and the Cursed Child by J.K. Rowling**
	+ I have heard that the stage production of this play was an experience to behold and I hope I have the opportunity in the future. Frankly, I wasn’t sure I would like to go back to this universe. I was just older than the Harry Potter craze and didn’t read the books until Book 5 was released; I fell in love with the story and the characters, but I was happy when the story was complete. This was a valid followup, a unique story, and I can imagine a great experience in person. Just like Hamilton through the soundtrack, I am glad I was able to get a taste of the experience before the long wait to see it myself.
+ **The BFG by Roald Dahl**
	+ Started reading this book to my four-year-old daughter, who made it through 2/3 of the book before getting bored. I finished it and I’m glad I did. My biggest take away is just how OK nonsense writing can be. I was a little worried that my daughter would start talking like the giant, bad grammar and all, but she barely understood why his nonsense talk was funny in the first place.
+ **Our God Is Undocumented: Biblical Faith and Immigrant Justice by Ched Myers, Matthew Cowell**
	+ Simply put, this is an inspiring and impassioned treatise on how the church as a whole has failed to follow the Bible’s mandate on immigrant justice.
+ **The Colorado Kid by Stephen King**
	+ TBD
+ **Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Neil**
	+ TBD
