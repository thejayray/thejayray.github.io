title: Finding Purpose

I went through a bit of a slump this summer. With overwhelming amounts of stressful work, family, and personal situations all vying for my attention, I just couldn’t bring myself to write without the proper time and thoughtful consideration I expect from myself when writing for the site. I even took my site down for a time due to how full my brain felt.[^1]

In my overwhelmed state, I felt a loss of purpose and recently came to grips with what I was feeling and how to combat it. With the help of [Nash P][2] and a few others, I decided that my slump had to end and in a big way, so I’ve started to write and share again, but I’ve also started to [help][3] others with their own stuff.

This site runs on Blot. I tell you this since it is a commonality between my site, Nash P’s, and others for whom this story matters. I don’t generally consider myself a programmer, but I understand code just like any other person who spends enough time around it and similar puzzles. One way I see myself helping others is in sussing out code problems and giving advice about design and approaches to technology. Long story short, I have helped Nash with a few things and want to help others in the same way.

Blot uses the Mustache templating engine to render pages. The nicest thing about it is the simplicity that it can provide for those who want a blog that just works, while providing the flexibility that other templating engines have without the excessive learning curves. Blot also has a number of nice touches to complete the simplicity chain, such as folder-based post tagging and automation capabilities that come by way of its use of Dropbox as a file server.

For [Janea.net][4], Nash and I set out to provide a dead simple way for the purveyor to post folders of pictures and render them as photoblogs. In the end, we ended us using all of the above-noted features to provide such an avenue. Janea now simply creates a folder in the right style, drops her jpeg photos in with a URL-safe naming convention, and the new page exists, ideally with all the photos in their proper place. In a truly holistic approach, I did the coding, tested it, formatted old items according to the new syntaxes, and wrote documentation for reference, my own, Nash’s, and Janea’s.

I’m dedicated to service in both my personal and professional life; so is Nash. We thought it best to write something up on this little endeavor to discuss our consulting work, both of which are represented by pages on our sites at “/help”: [here][5] and [here][6]. If you have a project, idea, or need, reach out and we’d be glad to help.

[^1]:	I don’t mean to belittle the statement I made by taking my site down. It is important that readers know just how much noise there really is in our world right now, most of it unnecessary and hard to ignore. I don’t want to add to the noise even now, but I need to communicate to keep myself sane. Ideally, my blog can help fight the noise to bring light to areas that are kept in shadow.
