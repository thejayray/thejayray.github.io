title: Learning Italian from Marketing Emails: Sprezzatura
---

>The Italians have a word, sprezzatura, which means effortless elegance. Handcrafted in Italy, our Bologna Flex Collection embodies that concept with shoes that combine modern American styling with the sophisticated, low profile look of a fine Italian sports car. Unlike welted shoes, Bologna flex construction attaches the upper directly to the sole without the use of an insole or cork foot bed. The result is a sleeker, lighter and more flexible shoe.
