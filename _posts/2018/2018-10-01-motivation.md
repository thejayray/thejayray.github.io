I very rarely listen to podcasts anymore.<br>
I was listening to one at the behest of a new friend;<br>
A topic came up that really spoke to me:<br>
Motivation.<br>

Everyone has to find their own motivation.<br>
If you canâ€™t find something to motivate you,<br>
You cannot do the thing being require of you.<br>

Nash spoke to the idea that the hardest part of moving forward:<br>
Getting started after a stopping point. <br>
My blog space(s) can attest to that.<br>

Each time I think about writing,<br>
I think about how long it has been since my last post,<br>
How stale the content might become after a time.<br>
Living documents are like that.<br>

Shouting into the void is tiring,<br>
excessively futile.<br>
But it serves a purpose<br>

For the tinkerer in me,<br>
For the creative in me,<br>
For the socialite in me,<br>
For the nostalgic in me,<br>
For me.
