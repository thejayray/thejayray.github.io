title: Sleep is Awesome

>I started waking up earlier because I wanted to spend time in the evenings with my wife, had a job during the rest of the day, and a 45 minute (each way) commute — rising early was the only way to seamlessly add time to my day. And it’s true what people say — it’s eerily quiet in the early morning. Perhaps, though I am guessing, because most of the population realizes that sleep is kind of awesome.
