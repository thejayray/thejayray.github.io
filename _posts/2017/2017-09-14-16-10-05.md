title: Romeo and Juliet: A Novel by David Hewson

From [my reading page][1], where I keep track of the books I have read recently:
> This Audible Original audiobook gained a lot of attention in certain circles when it was first released. I was once into audiobooks a lot more than I am now due to the nature of previous commutes (i.e. driving to work versus riding the bus), but I am a reader at heart more than a listener. This book is available (at least as of now) in audio form only and, honestly, I could listen to Richard Armitage read all day long. All that aside, David Hewson has adapted other Shakespeare plays into novels before and the idea intrigued me enough to purchase this. In short, this is possibly the best adaptation I have ever read/heard. The idea of taking a classic work of this magnitude and making it better is no small feat, but going a step further to revitalize and expound upon it is amazing. And I love Juliet as a strong-willed, intelligent, and much more feministic character.

Check out the Audible page for the book [here][2].
