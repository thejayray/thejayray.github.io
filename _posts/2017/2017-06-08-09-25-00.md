> James B. Comey said Thursday that “shifting explanations” for his firing confused him and that the Trump administration defamed him, as he testified in Congress about a series of private conversations in which he said the president sought a pledge of loyalty and a public declaration that he was not personally under investigation for possible links to Russia.
> 
> Comey sat grim-faced at a witness table before the Senate Intelligence Committee shortly after 10 a.m. as the committee chairman, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), began the hearing by calling for a “very open and candid discussion’’ about the “strained relationship’’ between the president and Comey. Comey’s written account of those discussions, made public on Wednesday, have fueled the debate over whether the president may have attempted to obstruct justice by pressuring the FBI director about a sensitive investigation.

**UPDATE**:  The Washington Post also tracked the headlines of three major news organizations (MSNBC, CNN, and Fox) while the testimony was in progress [here][2]. Quite interesting to see the narrative progression.
