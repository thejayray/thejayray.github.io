Unfortunately, this link can only be viewed on the iOS App Store: [7 Games to Pre-Order Now](https://itunes.apple.com/us/story/id1324271450)

>New-feature alert: You can now pre-order apps and games to have them downloaded to your iPhone or iPad right when they're released. Just note that you'll need iOS 11.2 or later to use this feature. (If the Get buttons below are grayed out, try upgrading to the latest iOS.)
