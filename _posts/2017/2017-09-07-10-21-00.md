Email Newsletters with heart and a hope for feedback is definitely a trend and I would suggest you subscribe to the following two.

From [Patrick Rhone][1]:
> Try it on social media. Choose someone at random from your feed or someone you’ve followed for a while but may not communicate with often. Or, if your shy, someone you know really well. The “who” really doesn’t matter to be honest, the “what” does. Shoot them a reply that pays them a compliment out of the blue. From my time there and my brief ventures in during my sabbatical, social media seems to have become an increasingly negative and impersonal place. Therefore, think of how much more impact a random positive direct compliment can have. It could help.

From [Nash Pitre][2]:
> My site is my site, and I want this to be different. I want this to be a relationship. A friendship. A direct conversation. I want your feedback. I want your help. I've experimented with hundreds of ideas within the last decade, and the one thing I've learned is: it's ALWAYS better when you include others. As an introvert, this is difficult at times, but I'm slowly breaking out of that, and I'm finding new ways to collaborate and involve others in the things I create.
