> It’s not that I don’t consider the opportunity to move to a new device when the opportunity arrises. One recent instance of this actually came from a seemingly unlikely source — i broke my iPad mini. It fell off a table onto a concrete coffeeshop floor screen first and shattered. I use my mini a lot. It’s my second most used device. I was crestfallen. So, in considering whether to do nothing and go without, have the screen repaired, replace the it, or go another direction, I considered the option of moving to a iPhone 6 or 7 plus. From those I know with them they have replaced both their iPhones and iPads with one single device. This idea of replacing two devices with one appealed to me and I gave it some serious consideration. But, then a good deal came up on a brand new iPad mini 4 better than the one I lost. Sometimes, fate shows you the way.

There comes a time in each person’s life when they must find happiness in what they have. The sentiment reminds me of *The Giving Tree* when, in the end, an old man with nothing to show from a life of chasing material things just needs a place to sit and rest.

I think I’ll rest with my current iPhone for a little while longer.
