> **Who is affected?**
> 
> The travel ban affects visa applicants from six predominantly Muslim nations: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
> 
> Visas will be granted to those who can prove — in a formal and documented way — that they have a close relationship with a family member living in the United States or that they are connected with an entity such as a workplace or university.
> 
> The State Department's new guidelines stipulate that a close family member is a parent, spouse, sibling, son, daughter, son-in-law or daughter-in-law. Stepfamily relationships also apply.
> 
> The government doesn't consider close relationships to include grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, fiances and other “extended” family members.
> 
> -The Washington Post, "[45's] new travel ban requires you to prove a close relationship. Grandpas didn’t make the cut."
