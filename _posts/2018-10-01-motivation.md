# Motivation

I very rarely listen to podcasts anymore.
I was listening to one at the behest of a new friend;
A topic came up that really spoke to me:
Motivation.

Everyone has to find their own motivation.
If you canâ€™t find something to motivate you,
You cannot do the thing being require of you.

Nash spoke to the idea that the hardest part of moving forward:
Getting started after a stopping point. 
My blog space(s) can attest to that.

Each time I think about writing,
I think about how long it has been since my last post,
How stale the content might become after a time.
Living documents are like that.

Shouting into the void is tiring,
excessively futile.
But it serves a purpose

For the tinkerer in me,
For the creative in me,
For the socialite in me,
For the nostalgic in me,
For me.
