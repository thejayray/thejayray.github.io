Barnes and Noble needs to talk up this Nook Tablet feature! - Nook's Advertising Is Corrected - NYTimes.com

Read the short piece; it’ll make you realize that the Kindle Fire is junk…

> Second, I compared the Kindle Fire and the Nook Tablet. Side by side, identical movie playing in perfect sync from the same Netflix stream.
> 
> There’s not a shred of doubt: The Nook Tablet’s Netflix video looks a lot better.
> 
> Now, without the side-by-side comparison, you wouldn’t complain about the Fire’s video. But face-to-face with the Nook — forget it. The sharper, better detail of the Nook’s Netflix picture is immediately apparent. (You don’t see that clarity difference when the source material starts out at standard definition, like Hulu stuff.)
