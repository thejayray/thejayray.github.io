> The thing is, it’s really hard to talk about how Steve loomed in my world. I mean, as guy who’s been into computers for as long as I can remember, Steve entered my world when I was ten or so, and he’s been there ever since. I mean…shit, I dunno, only Neil Armstrong may loom larger in my world than Steve did, and he pretty much had to walk on the moon to do that.
