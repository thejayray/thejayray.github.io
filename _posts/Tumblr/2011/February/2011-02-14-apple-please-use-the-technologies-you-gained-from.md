I completely agree that Apple isn’t going to give everyone 100GB of storage in the cloud, but what I am hoping is that Apple uses Lala’s ability to stream from what a user’s library has in it by identifying the music, video, etc in each library.  This would entail that Apple has one copy of a song and anyone who owns that song (in their iTunes Library at home) is able to stream it from Apple’s cloud store of Music.  The same would then be true for videos purchased in the iTunes store and so on… think about it, people!
