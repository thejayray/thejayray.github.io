Just think of a time when there are programs that aren’t exclusively distributed via one or the other medium, but both mediums in tandem. Right now, there are “web series” and there are “television series.” At some point there will be simply “series” and people will need to make sure that they are watching on both TV and the web to get the full effect.

I have gotta start doing full write ups on these ideas!
