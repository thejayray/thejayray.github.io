Short but profound muralist documentary about an amazing cultural (and sadly misunderstood) part of Chicago: Pilsen.

Pilsen is known for its mural art: each one is a statement about life in  Pilsen or life before or after Pilsen. They’re messages to visitors and  to residents; reminders about leaders and struggles. Watch this  documentary from my friend Francesco about Marcos Raya, one of the first muralists.
