title: Tech News Is So Phenomenally Boring - Gawker
---

I agree emphatically with this post, which is the main reason for my long form quote below. Read on!

> In tech media, this has been treated as if a full-scale replica of Machu Picchu had been discovered on the far side of the moon. Marvel at these “spectacular” features of the leaked Facebook iPad app, revealed!
> 
> 1.  It does everything you can do on Facebook.
> 2.  Except on an iPad.
> 
> But just when you thought it could not get any less exciting, Facebook blocked the iPad app, prompting a hacker to develop a whole new app called FaceForward, the sole purpose of which is to allow you to use the leaked Facebook app. FaceForward will also be blocked and another hacker will make another Facebook-iPad-app-enabling app which will also be disabled. This supposedly is sticking it to Facebook, though, if you think about it, Mark Zuckerberg isn’t wasting hours trying to unlock a Facebook iPad app that will be available to everyone in a few days.
