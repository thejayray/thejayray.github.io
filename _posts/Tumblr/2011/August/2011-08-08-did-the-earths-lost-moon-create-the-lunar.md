I just finished reading [Andrew Chaikinâ€™s A Man on the Moon](http://www.amazon.com/Man-Moon-Voyages-Apollo-Astronauts/dp/014311235X/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1 "A Man on the Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts") and I have found a new appreciation for the moon through the stories of the Apollo missions. This Ars Technica find is merely an extension of that interest and new-found reverence. Awesome!
