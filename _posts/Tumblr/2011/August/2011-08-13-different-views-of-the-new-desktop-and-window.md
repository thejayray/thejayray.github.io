title: Different views of the new desktop and window management paradigms in Lion
---

What I find most interesting about these types of posts is just how divided people are on these features. I love the idea of having a main desktop just a swipe away from a full screen version of iTunes or Final Cut Pro, while others detest the new Mission Control paradigms.

> With fullscreen apps and Mission Control, Apple has made multiple desktops easy to use, easy to understand, and most crucially for me, easy to get started with. While not everyone likes fullscreen apps or gestures, to me, this is an example of exactly what Apple is trying to accomplish with Lion: creating a system where the average user immediately knows what to do and feels comfortable doing it; where interactions with the computer feel natural and automatic.
