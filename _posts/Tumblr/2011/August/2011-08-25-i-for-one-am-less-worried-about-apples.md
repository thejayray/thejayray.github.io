title: First-person impression of Apple’s new CEO - TUAW
---

"I, for one, am less worried [about Apple's succession plan] after reading this piece and you should read it, too."

All the news is talking about what Apple will be like without Steve and how there has to be a deeper and longer term plan regarding succession, but this piece simply points out who Tim Cook is and why Apple will be OK with him at the helm. I, for one, am less worried after reading this piece and you should read it, too, no matter how you feel.

> No one can ever replace Steve Jobs, the man, the genius. But Apple is not only Steve Jobs, no matter what anyone thinks. Apple is the interns and executive assistants; it’s the retail employees and the designers; it’s the marketing and PR departments, it’s Scott Forstall and Jonathan Ive; Bob Mansfield and Phil Schiller; it’s the dozens of other names you see on all those Apple patents that we talk about every week. Apple is not any single one of these people. It is the sum of them all, run by a leader who possesses enough wisdom to know that everyone in the company matters, that everyone’s concerns are valid and deserve attention. Tim Cook is such a leader.
