> I loved the Flip. I loved that its creators, year after year, resisted the urge to gunk it up with complexity and featuritis. I love that it never, ever, let me down. I loved that this startup company created something that changed the world, and ultimately reaped the rewards in popularity and sales.

Truly a sad thing when good technology will go to waste in the corporate realm, instead of doing a good thing for the consumer.
