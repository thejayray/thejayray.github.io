title: There's No Place Like Home Screen - The Philosophy of App Placement

Great look into the philosophies behind app placement. I have read a lot of articles where writers expound on their specific prowess behind app placement; I am glad someone took a step back to discuss it from a 50-foot perspective. Vardy does just this and I find it enlightening. Now I can’t wait to get home to look at my own philosophy and see where I am lacking clarity in my iOS home screen layout (I know, I’m a nerd)!
