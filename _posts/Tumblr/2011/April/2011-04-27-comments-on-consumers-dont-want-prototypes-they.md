title: Comments on "Consumers Don't Want Prototypes (They Want iPads)"
---

ReadWriteWeb’s Sarah Perez has written a great bird’s-eye view of the current state of things in the mobile technology industry. It is really unfortunate that the author is correct in his points.

1.  Windows Phone: waiting for a hardware partner or software update to cure all ills
2.  Android tablets as app-less commercial failures
3.  Android phones as shipping prototypes
4.  RIM’s Playbook as unfinished software on top of production hardware
5.  The iPad 2 as the winner, with the rest simply “a lot of spaghetti thrown against a wall [with] some that will stick.”

But here is the best line from the article:

> Many consumers wait for a company to tell them, “this is the answer, this is beautiful, this is perfect.” Apple’s messaging does exactly that, and while, on a personal level, the increasingly pretentious [commercials](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5of4Rx0iJBk) drive me a little batty at times, (_“when technology gets out of the way…that’s when you leap forward…iPad2”)_, at least **Apple isn’t asking for us to believe in a prototype.**

Note: Emphasis as originally written
