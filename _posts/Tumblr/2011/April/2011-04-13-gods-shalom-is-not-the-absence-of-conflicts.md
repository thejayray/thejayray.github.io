> God’s shalom is not the absence of conflicts. God’s shalom is the presence of resolutions to conflict that preserve the safety and dignity of all and do not require taking up arms. God’s way results in win-win. War is always lose-lose. For too long, we have learned our conflict resolution strategies from West Point, Annapolis and the School of the Americas.
