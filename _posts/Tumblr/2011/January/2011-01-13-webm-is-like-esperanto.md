Tim Sneath of Microsoft, the self proclaimed President of the United States of Google, has made a point of analogizing the H.264 v WebM debate that Google has just thrown into the heat to English v Esperanto language that failed to bring politicos together with a common language.  Pretty funny sentiment, if you ask me.
