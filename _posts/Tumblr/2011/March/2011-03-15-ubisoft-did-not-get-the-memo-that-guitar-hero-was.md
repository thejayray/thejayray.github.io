> “Guitar Hero is a party game. Rocksmith is a music experience”, Ubisoft tells The Hollywood Reporter, pointing towards the fact that the game comes not with bundled plastic instruments but a jack that allows users to plug a real electric guitar into an Xbox 360 or PS3.

Although I understand where the Gawker site is coming from in its analysis, I also see the virtue in this type of gaming experience… I for one always hated the fact that as a real guitar player, I could never get the hang of that stupid plastic POS.  Plugging in a real guitar may not bring a lot of people back to the genre, but it does bring a new twist to a now old idea and I like that idea.
