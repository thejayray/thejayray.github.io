> <span>But the Motorola Atrix leapt out at me with some real differentiation. It’s an [Android](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9178688/Android_news_reviews_more) phone and very capable, but that’s not anything special right now. It’s powered by a Tegra 2 dual-core chip with a super-high-resolution display on AT&Ts 4G network. That’s the type of distinction that makes it the best Android device you can buy… this week. It’s the sort of distinction that’s often short lived.</span>

<span>The fact that the hardware is not a differentiator worries me.  The fact is the Atrix is one of the biggest innovations in the Android space due to the other ideas implemented in it, but it is lost in the shuffle due to the fact that this hardware/software pairing is now commoditized.  We shall see how other manufacturers implement some of the ideas brought forward in the Atrix, but my hope is that it is true innovation on top of this technology, not the “me too” paradigm that has arisen in the Android community.  Everyone should read this review since it is a Mac magazine with a semblance of praise for a phone not made by Apple, Inc.</span>
