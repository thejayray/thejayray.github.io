> It’s a balance. I don’t want to die poor, and I don’t want to live miserably and die rich either.

I am not sure to whom Mr. Arends is trying to give advice. In the first place, I will admit that he has a good point; that investment is important. What I don’t agree with is the sense that any such expense is not worth it based on how much I may not have when I die. I think I would rather have great things to look back to while I live in general comfort, especially in comparison to those with nothing, which unfortunately will be more people than it should be. I hope I continue to live with the sentiment that living life and helping others is more important that worrying about my financial security thirty years from now.
