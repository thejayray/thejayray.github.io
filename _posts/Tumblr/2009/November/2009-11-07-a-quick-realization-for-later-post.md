title: A quick realization for later post
---

While playing a game on my wife’s iPod Touch called [Textropolis](http://nimblebit.com/games/textropolis/ "NimbleBit Site") [[iTunes Link](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/browserRedirect?url=itms%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252FWebObjects%252FMZStore.woa%252Fwa%252FviewSoftware%253Fid%253D301643671%2526mt%253D8%2526uo%253D6%2526partnerId%253D30%2526partnerId%253D30%2526siteID%253D0JkCNyaaKoo-UHdvZpDKkgQkybZqweqMQQ "iTunes Link")] (good game, btw), I realized the game is flawed. The game calls forward the name of a city and asks the player to create words from the letters in the city’s name, similar to anagrams. As a die-hard Scrabble player, I pride myself on these types of word games. I truly enjoy their inner workings and the reasoning behind their creation. However, when I unlocked Port Louis, I found the flaw. If you look for anagrams, any word buff might see the word, “slut” in Por**t** **L**o**u**i**s**. However, upon entering that word, I found that the app didn’t think my submission was valid. This is my problem with the current Apple App Store rating and submission system (more on this when I ponder a full post). What I’d like to point out is the fact that the developer felt the need to rid the game of a valid word choice in order to stay a harsh rating or the frat boy creators missed the word “slut” as an option (unlikely!). This simply seems ludicrous and I will post more, as I have more information on the subject of the rating system.
