title: For later: Flash Poster Frames
---

It is a sad day when a man can’t find the information he needs on the Internet because technologists are stuck in the past!

I thought all my followers would like to take a look at what I have been dealing with recently.  Technology moves forward (most likely the title of my “for later” piece), but people don’t like to move with it.  I am fairly new when it comes to ActionScript and Flash CS4, but all the people out there, stuck in the dark ages of ActionScript 2.0 need to buck up and move the newer standard, 3.0\.  When technology moves forward, you need to move with it or else you will be left in the dust!  Just saying…

Thank you, monkeyflash.com for moving with me!
