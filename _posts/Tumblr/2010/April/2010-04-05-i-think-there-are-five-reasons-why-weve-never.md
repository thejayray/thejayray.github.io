> I think there are five reasons why we’ve never enjoyed reading books on our computers:
> 
> 1) The distance between reader and the text is too large  
> 2) Vertical orientation is unnatural for book consumption  
> 3) Using a mouse to manipulate position in a book is sterile  
> 4) Computer screens aren’t technically optimized for text  
> 5) Desktop OSes aren’t optimized for concentration
