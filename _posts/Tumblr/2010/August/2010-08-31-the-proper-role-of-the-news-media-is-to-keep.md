title: Hand Jon Stewart The Keys To Your Failing Network

> The proper role of the news media is to keep people informed about the reality behind media spin and part of the job is to expose both the Democratic and Republican parties for their unique forms of hypocrisy. That’s what The Daily Show does so well and what CNN does so poorly. It’s time to let Stewart and team shake things up in Atlanta. Open minded, smart irreverence would do a much better job of tackling the news.
