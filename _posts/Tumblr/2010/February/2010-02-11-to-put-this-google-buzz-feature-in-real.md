> To put this [Google Buzz “feature”] in real terms:
> 
> • A girl you slept with in college sends you a message on Gchat, to tell you she has five beautiful children now, and that she doesn’t ever think about you, ever. Ok!  
> • You exchange some messages and a couple emails to be polite. You defuse the situation. You don’t mention it to your current girlfriend, because that would be weird.  
> • Coincidentally, you enable Google Buzz, which adds both your current girlfriend and this lady who you politely deflected.  
> • Your girlfriend checks out your Google profile, sees your friends list, and asks you who that lady is.  
> • You clumsily try to explain, “Oh, it just adds people you talk to automatically,” which only makes things worse.  
> • Fight!  
> • …  
> • You break up, which was probably a good thing anyway, because your relationship sounded really unhealthy. But you get the point, right?
