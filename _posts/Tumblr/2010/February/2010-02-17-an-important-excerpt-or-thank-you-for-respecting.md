title: An Important Excerpt, or "Thank you for respecting that."
---

The following is an excerpt from my recent blog post regarding phone choices.  It is important enough to reiterate as its own post.

I think what my writing recently has come to is this: I don’t care about technology like other people do.  I am not a fanboy in any way.  I may prefer a specific phone or OS, but I have chosen based entirely on what I do and how a computing platform makes what I do easier on a daily basis.  I have never been a competitive person and I do not feel the need to argue semantics surrounding computers, phones, code, or otherwise.  I am a technologist who explores, who learns, who chooses but never makes another person’s choice for them.  Thank you for respecting that.
