title: The Way I Feel About Optical Drives
---

TUAW has a couple good ideas for Apple and this one echoes exactly my thoughts:

“Remember the big stink when Apple eliminated removable batteries in their MacBook line? For all the uproar, how did Apple’s bold move actually pan out? The people who thought they couldn’t live without the option to have an extra battery on hand are doing just fine. A lack of an optical drive on future MacBooks will have the same effect – real world usability will not be hindered at all, and the absence of said drive will lead to thinner, lighter, and more power-efficient MacBooks.”

Comment: Not to mention the fact that those who need optical drives can buy modular hardware that will solve their woes.  That way they can decide whether they need the drive case by case.
