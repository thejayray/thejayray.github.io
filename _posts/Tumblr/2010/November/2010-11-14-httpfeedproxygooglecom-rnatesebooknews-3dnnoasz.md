title: Is this the start Nook product fragmentation?
---

“I stopped by my local BAM store today, and they told me that they will actually be carrying the Books-A-Million Nook. It’s a minor difference, but it is a difference. Their Nook will be tied to the BAM ebookstore, not B&N. It’s also going to carry BAM markings, not B&N.” -[the digital reader](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/NatesEbookNews/~3/DnnOASz639Y/)
