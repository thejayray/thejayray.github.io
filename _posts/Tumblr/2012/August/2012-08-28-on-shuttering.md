I have had a good time using tumblr over the years; I have enjoyed linking and sharing. But honestly, keeping up with a blog is hard work and there are enough voices to share what I enjoy. Tumblr has made the process basically painless, but what I recently realized is that I lack the desire to write what I really want to discuss. I would prefer instead to meet up with people over coffee and discuss it in that style instead.

Hereâ€™s the issue: when writing about technology in this day and age, you are dealing with a cutthroat industry. When I started to read about the fact that some of the more prominent writers post hundreds of links and dozens of full-length posts per week, I was reminded about just how little I care.

Now, when I choose to share something or comment on something, I will do so through other means, whether that be Facebook, Twitter, or any of the other services of which I am now a member. Once I am done with my graduate degree, I will rethink this decision.

Of course, if you are reading this, you might want to think about messaging me on Facebook or Twitter or something because we should be friends or at least acquaintances.
