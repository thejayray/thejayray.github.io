For anyone that already feels bad about giving up on their New Year's resolution, get ready to be punch in the junk...

> <span></span>
> 
> With the coming of a new year there is a lot of talk concerning resolutions. This always makes me think of one of my favorites from church history, Jonathan Edwards, and the resolutions he wrote as a young man concerning his life in God.
> 
> Many new year’s resolutions fizzle out quickly–and are often related to superfluous things.
> 
> If you need some resolution for the new year, try some of these on for size. Attempting to walk these out by the grace of God will have far reaching affect in your life (read I Timothy 4:6-9).
> 
> Also, if you are in need of some good reading this new year, I recommend George Marsden’s biography of [Jonathan Edwards](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300105967/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rondow-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0300105967)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rondow-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0300105967). Or, if you are up to reading Edwards himself, I suggest starting with [Religious Affections](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300158416/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rondow-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0300158416)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rondow-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0300158416) or [Freedom of the Will](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300158408/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=rondow-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0300158408)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=rondow-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0300158408).
