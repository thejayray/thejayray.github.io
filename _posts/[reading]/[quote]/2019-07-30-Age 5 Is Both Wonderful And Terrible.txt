> Five has so many emotions, and all those emotions seem best expressed by crying. All you can do is cuddle and wait for the storm to pass, if you’re patient. I am seldom gifted with patience. I usually sigh and drop my head in my hands and try to remember that the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon but dammit, kid, will you please stop weeping because you spilled your Gatorade?
