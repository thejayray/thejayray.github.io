title: I'm Reading About the Apple Watch
---

This is probably the best Apple Watch review I’ve read thus far; everything I wrote [yesterday][1] still stands.

> No matter how hard Apple tries to steer clear of being related to timepieces, it’s inevitable. Humans have two wrists and are very unlikely to wear a watch on each, so the conscious decision to wear an Apple Watch or a traditional watch is made each day. The two are intertwined and, therefore, competitors.
