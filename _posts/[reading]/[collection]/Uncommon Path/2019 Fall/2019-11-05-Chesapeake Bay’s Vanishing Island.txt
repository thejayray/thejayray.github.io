> Just like Spry’s Island, Holland, Sharps and Great Cove, other largely forgotten Chesapeake islands. Just like the hundreds of bay islands that have vanished in decades and centuries past.

But now, in a diabolical marriage of climate-accelerated sea-level rise and the existing erosion, Tangier is dissolving exponentially faster.
