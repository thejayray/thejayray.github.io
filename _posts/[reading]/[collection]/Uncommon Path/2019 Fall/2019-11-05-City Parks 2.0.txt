> Several cities are aiming for spaces that embrace their location and give locals more intersections with the outdoors. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, a new destination blends classic nature features with intricate playgrounds and relaxing nooks. In Atlanta, green spaces woven around a planned transit overhaul ease living, working and commuting in a congested metro area. And in Chicago, a stretch of plants floating in the river wraps educational opportunities into a greenery-laced boardwalk. These aren’t the only unusual green spaces cropping up around the country, but they’re among the leaders in reimagining the city park for a new age.
