<p>I was going to write a blog post for today, which is funny because I didn&#8217;t. Instead, I spent time with my wife; we don&#8217;t get all that much time together, so it was nice and necessary. During that time, I didn&#8217;t post to Twitter, Facebook, or any other site. I didn&#8217;t take any pictures and I didn&#8217;t share our moments because they are ours and not anyone else&#8217;s. What is more, these thoughts were meant for another post, which is yet forthcoming. That post is about how the best times are those when I feel no need to share or document. No, this post&#8212;the one you are currently reading&#8212;comes now because I have many posts in progress, but none ready for publishing. I have said before that I will not publish until ready and I want to stand by that sentiment. Have a great week!</p>
