title: Walk the World
--- 

Back in April, I stumbled onto a public beta for an app called Walk The World. To my great excitement, they released to the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/walk-the-world-virtual-trails/id6743502929?l=es-MX) last week. This is one of those apps that just clicked for me and I have been very happy to be a part of shaping it into the wonderful 1.0 that it is today; this is the reason why I beta test apps.

Walk The World is a simple concept: the app takes your step count each day and allows you to spend the steps on trails that exist around the world. Along the way, you encounter landmarks and wildlife, earning badges as you complete sets of walks. I have now walked through multiple iterations of these maps, providing different experiences, outcomes, and rewards.

As one might guess, I ended up completing all of the available walks after my trip to Italy this summer, having taken upwards of 20,000 steps per day while there for just under five weeks.

The reason why this app has been such a great experience though isn't all of the details that the developers ([Impending](https://www.impending.com), who circulates other apps that I love as well[^1]) got right, it is the notion that this type of app doesn't have to push or pressure the user in any way and it can still be a fun and gratifying experience anyway.

As you might guess, though, I love to beta test apps, I love to walk, and now I love to use this app as a playful way to experience virtual hikes in far-off places. I hope the Impending teams keep allowing me to help beta test and I hope they keep up their wonderful work.

Have fun and [check it out](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/walk-the-world-virtual-trails/id6743502929?l=es-MX)!
