title: iPhone Thoughts
summary: Coming up to the release of the newest model of iPhone, I have thoughts about Apple's work and a real buyer's dilemma.
--- 

Yesterday, I wrote a quick post ([don't call it a review](https://engineeredeloquence.com/2025/09/apple-os-updates)) about the updates to Apple's operating systems and the effects of those updates on the ecosystem of apps vis-Ã -vis Liquid Glass. Today, I am thinking about the iPhone and the updates that Apple has made to the range since I am in the market this year.

First, a little background: I have owned smartphones since Palm and Blackberry were at the height of their popularity. My first modern (read: iPhone-like/all screen) smartphone was a Samsung Galaxy that I got for free from a carrier. My first iPhone was an original I got from a friend. My favorite iPhone was the iPhone 5s and, while I was on the Apple Upgrade Program at the time, I opted that year not to pursue an upgrade because of how much I loved that phone. (The iPhone 7 was a close second for me.)

I have owned multiple versions over the years and I replace my phone about every three years at this point because year-over-year improvements have less day-to-day impacts in this part of the smartphone era.[^1] However, my smartphone is also one of the only devices that I personally own and use daily, so I also need one that will last the aforementioned three year cycle and I prefer more minimalist styling.

With all that in mind, the iPhones that are being released this week are major updates, both on their own and as a collection. They have better processors, better cameras, bigger batteries, and more efficiency. Powered by the new [iOS 26](https://www.apple.com/os/ios/), there appear to be options for anyone needs and interests, which brings me to my buyer's dilemma.

I know that the iPhone 17 is the best value. It has a bigger battery and a better mix of technologies, all at a lower price point. But I also know that the iPhone Air is the first iPhone in awhile that was "desirable" to me. The device is svelte, forward thinking, and includes all of Apple's new chipsets; it has a good enough camera (because the ultra-wide is fine but mostly unnecessary) and it likely is the design language for the iPhones of the future.

The Pro models are gorgeous (especially in that Orange color), but I really don't need that much power and am not willing to take on the extra heft (both weight and thickness) right now; one unboxing referred to it as maximalist. Yep, nope.

Perhaps this all comes down to nostalgia, for simpler times and a more clearly-focused iPhone product matrix. Perhaps, in a phrase, the iPhone Air reminds me of classic Apple and I need more classic Apple in my life.

[^1]: I keep reading about the idea that the smartphone era is coming to an end, but I will believe that when I see it. Much ink has been spilt about the work that every company is doing in AI, but the main use cases for AI currently still require an input device. Whatever OpenAI is working on with LoveFrom (termed *[io](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(company))*) may open all of our eyes or may be a dud or may sit in the middle somewhere, but again, I am loath to acknowledge that we will see it supplant the smartphone in any short period of time.
