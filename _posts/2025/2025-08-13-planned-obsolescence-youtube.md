title: Planned Obsolescence, A YouTube Recording
--- 

While I was in Italy, the recordings from the 2025 IT Professionals Conference were posted. Below is the recording of the talk I gave; the text was posted for that last couple months and can still be found [here](https://engineeredeloquence.com/2025/05/planned-obsolescence-talk). Enjoy.
