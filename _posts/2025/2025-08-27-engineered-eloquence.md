Yesterday, I wrote my first blot post in awhile; it was a semi-impromptu hiatus that was predicated by my conference talk and my trip to Italy (See [Planned Obsolescence](https://engineeredeloquence.com/2025/05/planned-obsolescence-talk)). As I wrote about Tot version 2.0, I tried to take note about why that was the thing that drove me to post again. In a word, *excitement*.

I posted about Tot because I saw the news about the update and thought, "I have to tell someone about this!” It was one of those things that I knew would happen eventually, but came as a shock to even me around timing and subject matter. However, I think this has solidified for me the future of this space I have called home on the web for decades and in some sense helped me remember the original intent.

## Tools for Thoughtful Leaders

Engineered Eloquence was always intended to be a space in which I could share anything I desired. I established the name when it was hosted on Tumblr back in 2009 and included all the various types of media that Tumblr (as an early social network) allowed. More information on that part of the journey is included in [the History section](https://engineeredeloquence.com/about#some-relevant-history) of the site's About page.

The name came from my desire to use my extroverted, people-focused, engineer brain to craft and share eloquently-composed prose, no matter the subject. As social media became louder, this space became a refuge in which I could curate information and share about the things happening in my life, big and small. 

For much of the site's existence, the subject has coalesced around minimalism, technology, and parenthood. These are areas of interest and importance that will likely never change and they will continue to permeate my writing, but other areas of interest (leadership, advocacy, intentionality) have started to become more prominent in my daily life and subsequently in the content of the site. As such, it felt like time for a change, but not in name or approach, just in description/tag line.

I workshopped some things and came up with "Tools for Thoughtful Leaders" because in the end:

> I want to write about my journey through the lens of conscientious parenting and leadership, navigating technological change while choosing people over things.

Yep, that sounds about right.
