  <p>With iOS 7, I am releasing a large update to Basil. There’s a lot to talk about, and I’ll do so more this week, but I wanted to discuss the process around designing one of the main features: recipe timers.</p>

<p>Kyle has been working tirelessly on the iOS 7 update and I am glad that he is going to be sharing the design process with his audience. I have been beta testing the update for a few weeks now and have nothing but good things to report. I am really looking forward to tomorrow&#8217;s release of the iOS 7 update and, undoubtedly, all the other app updates that will follow. Click through to read Kyle&#8217;s thoughts.</p>
