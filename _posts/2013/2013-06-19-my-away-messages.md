Tweet: A list of a few articles I missed while away.

title: My Away Messages
---

<p>I wanted to post something I suppose I rarely think to: the articles that I missed while I was away. Lexi and I went on a short vacation this weekend, one of the last prior to our unborn child’s nativity and, as usual, the world kept spinning and the technology blogs kept posting. So instead of dealing with the inundation of reading material quietly, I thought I would make a list of the most interesting pieces I read this morning (and afternoon and evening). Again, this is not everything I have read nor are they the best in every category, but they are some of the easiest for quick reads and thought provocations. Enjoy!</p>

<p>“[iOS 7 is] a reimagining that catapults the system into a new era while retaining the most important intuitions built up over the last six years. … Apple has kept all the right things, and built a new experience celebrating the values behind them. iOS 7 is truly the sum of its parts.”</p>
