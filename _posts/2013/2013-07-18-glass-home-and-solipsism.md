<blockquote>
  <p>[Jack Dorsey] was perfectly right in the sense that the word elides the obligation you should feel to a customer. However, an equal problem is the use of the possessive itself. You can think of people as users or customers - but they&#8217;re not yours. They don&#8217;t belong to you, and they may barely even care that you exist.</p>

<p>Concise critique of Google&#8217;s recent moves away from the role of results provider towards a new role of landing page and social network.</p>

<p>In short: Google Glass points to a future with a more self-centered Google.</p>
