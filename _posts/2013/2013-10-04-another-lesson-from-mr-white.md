<blockquote>
<p>There are obvious reasons for watching “Breaking Bad”: for once the Hollywood hype surrounding the television series is justified. But there is also a less obvious reason: it is one of the best studies available of the dynamics of modern business. A Harvard MBA will set you back $90,000 (plus two years’ lost income). You can buy a deluxe edition of all five seasons of “Breaking Bad”, complete with a plastic money barrel, for $209.99, or a regular edition for less than $80.</p>

<p>There are many reasons to watch Breaking Bad, but this article really relates one that I would never have thought of. Plus, I don&#8217;t know about you, but I am happy to still have the $90k that would have otherwise gone to Harvard Business School. Thanks, Mr. White!</p>
