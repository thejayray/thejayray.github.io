Tweet: "iPhone 5S - Still the best, but no longer a leader". What does that even mean?

title: BiPolar Reading
---

<p>I would normally link to what I am discussing, but the article confused me in so many ways, I wanted to spare my readership from the same self-loathing that I felt when I finished. I&#8217;ll admit, I fell for the link-bait headline: &#8220;iPhone 5S - Still the best, but no longer a leader&#8221;. (What does that even mean?) The bipolarity of the article had me questioning my own sanity for the majority of it. As the author praises every part of the iPhone 5S, I was struck by the fact that the prose continued to lack any of the derision that was apparent in the title.</p>

<p>Here is my main issue, however: what the author is arguing to be lacking leadership in the market is iOS 7, not the iPhone itself. In the authors own words the iPhone itself is awesome, the best, a wonder of Apple&#8217;s iterative ways. So why not make a &#8220;this phone is great&#8221; article, with an aside or a separate &#8220;this software is not as innovative as everyone thinks&#8221; article? Why link-bait with almost no argument to prove your title statement?</p>
