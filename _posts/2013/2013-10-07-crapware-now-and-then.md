<p>You might not consider these preloaded apps such a big deal. We’re all used to getting crapware on new PCs; this is the same story, just on phones, and it’s not such a big hassle to delete everything you don’t need. But you shouldn’t have to delete stuff just to get your phone looking like you want it. Plus, I suspect that many users probably don’t even know how to delete these apps, so they just sit there, clogging up the home screen.</p>

<p>I remember being appalled by the amount of bad software that existed on PCs back in the day. Then, big box retailers would often sell you a computer and charge you more if you wanted them to get rid of the &#8220;crapware&#8221; for you. It seems just as shady now to force your customers to pay more than twice as much to get a &#8220;Google Play&#8221; version that lacks the terrible elements of the cheaper phone.</p>
