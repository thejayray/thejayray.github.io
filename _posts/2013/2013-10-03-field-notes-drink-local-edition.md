<p>Field Notes is at it again with their &#8220;Drink Local&#8221; Edition notebooks. Each time they come out with a new set of notebooks, I am tempted, which is saying something, as someone who doesn&#8217;t really use paper for anything anymore. Even more classy is the inclusion of a coaster set; well done!</p>
