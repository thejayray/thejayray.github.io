  <p>I was an Apple Genius-in-training and working part-time on the sales floor at the local Apple store when the first iPhone went on sale six years ago today.</p>
  
  <p>And boy, was it a circus.</p>

<p>I, too, worked at an Apple Store on launch day and I can attest to the circus environment. I worked at Apple&#8217;s flagship store in downtown Chicago and was thankfully working back of house that day, but the minute the doors opened to customers waiting in line, there was an energy like I have never felt before or since.</p>

<p>Thank you, Stephen! Your post brought back fond memories.</p>
