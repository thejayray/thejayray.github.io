  <p>But the reason I&#8217;m reminded of the GM story is the old computing term about &#8216;eating your own dog food&#8217;. Nexus devices and &#8216;official Google&#8217; devices are not Google&#8217;s dog food. They&#8217;re not what actual customers use.</p>

<p>I used a Samsung Galaxy S, called the Vibrant on T-Mobile, for a full two-year contract. I was unhappy with the phone six months in due to the lack of up-to-date software and support. Neither Samsung nor Google seem to care about long-term customer satisfaction and, it seems, Google employees don&#8217;t even know what the experience of a normal consumer is like. They are kept in a bubble, consisting of only the best version of Android: the stock version.</p>
