  <p>&#8220;<strong>Stop giving away for free news and information that people will happily pay for.</strong>&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While reading Henry Blodget&#8217;s account of going out and buying a newspaper, I was reminded that I am often tantalized by the idea of subscribing to my local paper. I use the term tantalized due to the nature of the relationship that most of us have with news outlets in general. News is offered for free in so many forms that the idea of paying for it seems anathema, while at the same time, if I want the best coverage of local topics, as Mr. Blodget did, I have to look to those who will give me that information: namely, local newspapers.</p>

<p>In addition, I am reminded of the fact that each time I go back home—to Chicago—I pick up my parents&#8217; newspaper and read it basically cover to cover. My parents still get the paper four days a week; part of their morning routine is to read it and, at times, I envy that routine, possibly due to a memory of a simpler time.</p>

<p>However (and I think this is Mr. Blodget&#8217;s point), <em>there are topics and insights that local news outlets can give us that simply aren&#8217;t available elsewhere</em>. These news outlets have a responsibility to monetize the things that make them unique if they want to stay viable.</p>
