<p>So, instead of chasing the highest number of eyeballs, we will chase and deliver the most valuable news. We’ve set the bar high. To succeed, we need to write articles that deliver value worth paying for. That’s why we’re a subscription publication.</p>

<p>We are in a world deeply in need of good publications, such as <em>The Information</em>. <em>The Verge</em> was a publication that got my hopes up when it was in its infancy, as being good articles from good writers about a wide range of technologies. <em>The Information </em>seems toexactly what I always hoped <em>The Verge</em> would become. A little out of my price range <a href="/2013/12/fatherhood-and-identity/" title="Fatherhood and Identity - Engineered Eloquence">right now</a>, but it sounds (and looks) awesome.</p>
