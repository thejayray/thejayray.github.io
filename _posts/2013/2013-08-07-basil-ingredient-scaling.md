<blockquote>
  <p>Today, Basil received a nice 1.6 update. This update brings a really obvious, simple feature that many other recipe applications include: ingredient scaling. It’s really convenient while in the kitchen to be able to adjust a recipe’s yield according to your needs (the amount of jambalaya you need for two on a quiet weeknight is a little different than the amount you need to make while having guests), and it’s conceptually very simple.</p>
  
  <p>Except it’s not so simple.</p>

<p>I assisted in beta-testing for this version of Basil. Kyle and I worked hard and we think we got all the edge cases for the new feature, but we are human and ingredient scaling has <em>a lot</em> of weird edge cases.</p>

<p>I know that ingredient scaling has been on my list of desired features for Basil for a long time, so I was glad when Kyle approached me with this addition. There are a few other features in the pipeline that I am really excited for, so stay tuned if you use Basil currently and if not, now is the time to <a href="http://basil-app.com" title="Basil for iPad">go buy it</a>!</p>
