<p>I watched this short video, which shows animated renders of what The Sagrada Familia will look like when it is done, with Lexi last night. We were both astounded at two things: how much there is left to do and how drastically different the final product will look in comparison to what we saw less than a decade ago.</p>

<p>My comment: &#8220;We, of course, will have to go back to Spain more to see it as it progresses.&#8221; To which, Lexi just nodded her head, &#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>
