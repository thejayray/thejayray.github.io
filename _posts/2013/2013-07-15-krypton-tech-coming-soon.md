<blockquote><p>Christopher MacManus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the future, we might be able to save our history to <a href="http://www.orc.soton.ac.uk/5dopticalstore.html">a glass storage medium that could potentially outlive humankind</a>. The new type of memory also touts mind-blowing specifications, such as 360TB per disc data capacity and the ability to withstand extreme temperatures up to 1,832 Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>By harnessing the power of a speedy femtosecond laser, researchers successfully wrote and read 300KB of data to an everlasting medium that consists of self-assembled nanostructures within fused quartz. Think of it as a real-life version of the memory crystals seen in the old â€œSuperman&#8221; movies.</p>
