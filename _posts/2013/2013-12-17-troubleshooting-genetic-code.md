<p>The fact that the genetic code can simultaneously write two kinds of information means that many DNA changes that appear to alter protein sequences may actually cause disease by disrupting gene control programs or even both mechanisms simultaneously.</p>

<p>Ever since my child was born on November 1, I have been fascinated by her and the fact that she grew from cells to a human being in nine months. Add to that the fact that I am a technologist and the findings by University of Washington are right up my alley. Within the technical support field, problems—like diseases—can have many causes, one of which could be programs attempting to write to the same system memory or running out of usable memory entirely; seems like our understanding of the human body is getting more and more like that of a computer with every new discovery.</p>
