<blockquote>
  <p><strong>So networks can&#8217;t really compete.</strong></p>
  
  <p>They tried with Friday Night Lights, which was ambitious and smart, and tried to do a lot of the things these cable shows did, but it simply couldn&#8217;t work. [They] couldn&#8217;t get enough people to watch it. <strong>Their imperative to have the largest possible ratings remains. There was a time, in the Second Golden Age, when networks believed it was part of their mission to have a small sliver of the dial set aside for prestige, for Emmy-winning shows, but they&#8217;ve ceded that to cable.</strong> That said, they&#8217;ve been much better at cultivating and sustaining almost revolutionary comedy during that period.</p>

<p>Emphasis is my own in the second portion of the quote. I wrote up <a href="/2013/05/fox-nbc-and-netflix-a-difference-in-priorities" title="A difference in priorities - Engineered Eloquence">a bit of a diatribe</a> about the current state of network television shows a little while back and I think this was really my point. Good television can be had, especially right now where the viewership is there for these cable shows. However, the moment that <em>an emmy-award winning television show</em> can&#8217;t get the numbers a network wants, it is abandoned because the money is more important than the prestige <em>or the customer satisfaction</em>.</p>

<p>Over at <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/07/10/respect-your-customer/" title="Respect your customer - The Loop">The Loop</a>, Jim linked to <a href="http://i-digress.co.uk/blog/2013/7/9/respect-your-customer" title="Respect your Customer - I Digress...">another great article</a> about the lack of respect for the customer in a similar style. Check that out, too, if you are interested.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, good article from The Atlantic.</p>
