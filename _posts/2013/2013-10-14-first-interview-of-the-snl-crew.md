<p>The minute the box set of the first SNL season was available, I bought it. I was not alive when the season initially aired, but I love this rare look into the first cast of the show. I don&#8217;t think I realized just how much uncertainty their was surrounding the show&#8217;s premise and success, but the above-documented moments and those first seasons are truly classic. Enjoy!</p>
