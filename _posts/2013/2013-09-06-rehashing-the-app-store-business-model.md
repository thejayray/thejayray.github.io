<blockquote>
  <p>Unless there is some sort of significant App Store regime change or a decision maker gets a bump on the head followed by an epiphany, upgrade pricing and demos are not coming to the App Store or Mac App Store. Adjust your apps and business models accordingly.</p>
  
  <p>-David Chartier, &#8220;Apple already answered our requests for App Store upgrade pricing and demos&#8221;</p>

<p>David has a great point and others, such as the venerable <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2013/09/on-free-trials-for-ios-apps/" title="On Free Trials for iOS Apps - Shawn Blanc">Adam Grossman and Shawn Blanc</a>, have decried the current rules regarding trials on the iOS and Mac App Stores. Neverthless, I am unsure that we will ever see a future in which free trials or upgrade pricing is a thing in Apple&#8217;s world. I am not on the App Store currently in any capacity, but in the future, for everyone&#8217;s sake, I hope that future consumers understand that, frugality aside, good things cost money.</p>
