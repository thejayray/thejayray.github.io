<p>It looks as though the main site, <a href="http://rolocule.com" title="Rolocule Games">Rolocule.com</a>, is down; once the site is back up for the underlying technology, I will have to check it out.</p>

<p>This type of motion technology looks to be well implemented and exactly where I want my Apple TV to go. I am not a gamer, but I always like to see integration of iOS games with the Apple TV.</p>
