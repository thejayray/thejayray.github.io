  <p>Given the high bar Apple has set (iPhone 5 technology), I (now) expect the iPhone 5C’s price to be on the high end of estimates, and possibly higher.</p>

<p>Today, Apple is expected to announce new iPhone (and iPod) hardware and set hard dates for the release of iOS 7. In celebration of such a joyous occasion in the world of Apple, I thought I would share the most sobering item I could find on the subject. Ben Thompson thinks we should all slow our rolls, so to speak, and realize that low cost does not mean cheap in iPhone terms. I will be waiting with bated breath this afternoon to see the final outcome of all this jaw-wagging, but I am nonetheless excited.</p>

<p>Generally, Apple live streams these events through <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/" title="Apple Events - Apple.com">their website</a>, but many other outlets are on-site and live blogging, so be sure to check them out. I&#8217;ll update this post (and <a href="http://twitter.com/jayray" title="Jay Ray - Twitter">Twitter</a>) with my sources when the time comes.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Just to help out with the search for a viable liveblog, I have listed just a few sites that will be covering the news. There are tons more blogs on-site, so be sure to follow the one that will give you the right coverage for your interests. Enjoy!</p>
