  <p>To me, that’s AI: the prediction of what my desired answer is, and the useful summary of the historical data that most humans would internalize. There’s a lot of companies out there that want to build this, but I don’t trust them. They want my data running through their servers — with Siri this could potentially all be done on the device, with anonymous meta-data sent out for quick analysis.</p>

<p>I am with Ben on what Artificial Intelligence should look like in the future, as well as who I am willing to trust to give me the desired information. I actually am surprised sometimes how often I use Siri on my iPhone because &#8220;she&#8221; honestly can&#8217;t do that much. Normally, I use the assistant for hands-free navigation and texting, but the other day, my colleague asked me a piece of trivia that I didn&#8217;t know.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Me</strong>: &#8220;Siri, is Mickey Rooney dead yet?&#8221;</p>
  
  <p><strong>Siri</strong>: &#8220;Here is what I found for you. (complete with Wolfram Alpha sheet on Mickey Rooney)&#8221;</p>
  
  <p><strong>Me</strong>: &#8220;How old would that make him?&#8221;</p>

<p>I am not saying that this use is in any way integral to my day, like Ben&#8217;s posed scheduling questions, but there are many parts to AI and, just like their OS offerings, Apple is snatching the low-hanging fruit in how they are building their still-in-beta voice assistant. First it was the essential items such as hands-free texting, then it was looking up movies, and now it is wikipedia, search, as well as purchasing and reserving; we can only hope that the service continues to get more robust in what information it can provide us when we ask question, from the fun to the fundamental.</p>
