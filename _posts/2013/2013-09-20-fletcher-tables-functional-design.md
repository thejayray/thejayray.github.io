<p>I meant to share this video yesterday because it is awesome, though expensive I am sure. Based on this video, I am unsure about the original designer, but <a href="http://fletchertables.com" title="Fletcher Tables">Fletcher Tables</a> has a very similar table design and they have additional videos about its inner workings. Check them out after the video and drool!</p>
