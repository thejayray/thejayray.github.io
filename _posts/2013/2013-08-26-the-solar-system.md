<p>This is a fantastic concept: an animated infographic. The video is well-narrated and contains a lot of little-known but impressive information, some of which I will admit I didn&#8217;t even know. These types of videos get me excited for fatherhood since I expect to share my love of Space exploration and astronomy with my children. I hope all the children out there posing as adults enjoy this as much as I did.</p>
