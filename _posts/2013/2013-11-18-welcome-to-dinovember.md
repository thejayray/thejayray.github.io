<p>Great idea and definitely inline with what Lexi and I believe in. Although we may not take it as far as these parents, we want to cultivate a sense of imagination, creativity, and wonder in our children in as many ways as we can. Also, Lexi commented that she loves the fact that the parents of two girls have dinosaurs and Teenage Mutant Nina Turtle toys, just as it should be.</p>
