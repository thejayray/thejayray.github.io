<p>I have to say, the story of Blackberry (née RIM) is a sad one to me. Reading this oral history by Bloomberg reminds me of just how tragic a story it is, full of missed opportunities and arrogance. The below text is from the last paragraph, but the whole article is really tastefully done and worth reading, although I would have loved to see some of the reactions of the former co-CEOs Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie, who both declined to comment for the story. I think Blackberry, no matter what the future holds, will have a special place in many people&#8217;s hearts for years to come, even if their devices are not in their pockets.</p>

<blockquote>When you go into the focus groups, and you talk to customers about brands in the technology space, there are brands that don’t come up at all anymore. And then there’s BlackBerry. People have fond sentiments about BlackBerry. If people didn’t have that affinity toward the brand, I would be challenged to really believe in what we’re doing. People want to see BlackBerry succeed.</blockquote>
