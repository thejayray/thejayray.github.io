<p>The Tiny House movement is one that really interests me, especially given a few of the other videos I have shared over the years. The idea of utilizing even the smallest of spaces effectively and in some cases making it ultra-livable plays at my minimalist heart strings. Hank&#8217;s journey takes an architecture degree and uses it to create a mobile living space inside a old school bus. This video is a discussion of the project as a whole, but there is a lot of great information about the project and the subsequent cross-country trip—in addition to images and deeper discussions—on <a href="http://www.hankboughtabus.com/a-tour-of-the-bus/" title="Hank Bought A Bus (Dot Com)">Hank&#8217;s website</a>.</p>
