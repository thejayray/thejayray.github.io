<p>One of my favorite bands of all time, Five Iron Frenzy, is putting out a new album later this year and have a great article over on Relevant (<strong>Warning: paywall</strong>). Here&#8217;s a taste:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Here’s what it is,” Roper says. “As time passes, I become more embarrassed by the Church, more embarrassed of the actions of Christians. I don’t want that to get in the way of me telling somebody about the love of Jesus Christ.”</p>
  
  <p>He adds, “I get the feeling a lot of our fans are in that place, too. We get a lot of emails from people who are like, ‘Hey, I loved you guys as a kid. You’re my favorite band. I’m not a Christian anymore, but I’m still very excited about the album.’ I want to write an album for those guys.”</p>
  
  <p>The album is being written by a few of those guys, actually, as two members of the band no longer call themselves Christian—an interesting dynamic for a band known for its faith. But for a group already comfortable on the fringes, it doesn’t seem odd. In fact, the band’s spiritually skeptical members have helped shape the album in surprising ways.</p>
