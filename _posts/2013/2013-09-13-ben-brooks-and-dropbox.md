<p>Ben Brooks discusses his recent search for Dropbox alternatives due to the fact that Dropbox stores encryption keys, which are susceptible to NSA &#8220;snooping&#8221;. He discusses BitTorrent Sync, ownCloud, and File Transporter, while also linking to other promising services.</p>

<p>With regard to BitTorrent Sync, which I (and apparently many others) brought to his attention over on App.Net, Ben enjoys the architecture that makes it naturally more secure. I originally brought it to his attention, in the vein of security, as a possible future replacement for email. However, BitTorrent Sync looks like a really great solution to many issue-laden technologies currently in use if it can simplify its processes and distance itself from the idea that all torrent-based technologies are illegal (a widespread misconception).</p>

<p>I have used Sync only marginally so far, but I have been impressed with what I have seen. After reading Ben&#8217;s accounts, I am interested in giving it more of an in-depth look in the near future.</p>
