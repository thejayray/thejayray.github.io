<blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s the double edge of the technology we now have in our pockets. It gives us access to boundless information, and enables all kinds of interactions with that information, but it doesn&#8217;t distinguish between empty and nourishing information, or help us determine the right uses of that information. We have to make those distinctions and those choices.</p>

<p>Another good look at the new Apple ad, complete with links to a few of the other articles that have been posted on the subject. My thoughts on technology within the life of my child stay the same, no matter the technology or the reason for its use. I love technology; I want to pass that love on to my children, but in due time and with the proper respect for usage of digital technologies in the physical world.</p>
