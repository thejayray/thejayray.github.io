<blockquote>
  <p>Despite (or perhaps because of) the sales push, many educators are still skeptical of tablets in the classroom&#8212;and Amplify seems designed to put them at ease. Its operating system gives teachers and schools an unprecedented level of control over the devices in students&#8217; hands. There is no home button, for example: Students can&#8217;t just exit out of a math program the way they can close Angry Birds on an iPad. Instead, if a teacher hits her &#8220;eyes on teacher&#8221; button, any or every student&#8217;s tablet in her classroom suspends; a message tells the student to look up. Or the teacher can call on a student randomly, and a message pops up on her screen. Or with just one click, a teacher can pose a multiple-choice pop quiz and see instant results, set a five-minute timer for an activity, or divide students into discussion groups. Or she can automatically give individualized homework assignments based on the day&#8217;s performance.</p>

<p>I was reading a print copy of this month&#8217;s Fast Company (not my subscription, mind you)—which solicited <a href="https://twitter.com/JayRay/status/369884257495166976" title="Jay Ray - Twitter">this tweet</a>—and came across an article entitled, &#8220;News Corp.&#8217;s Big Test&#8221;. For whatever reason, the online version has a different name, but the sentiment of the above blockquote is the same: the future of the classroom is awesome!</p>

<p>At a previous job, I did a lot of work with online educational software—Blackboard, Angel, and Moodle, in particular—and I was often dealing with the cutting edges of what such software could do at the time; it is amazing to me that the iPad had only just begun to make an impact on the classroom at that time. Looking into the future, I can see a real boon to teacher productivity and effectiveness due to tablet hardware and software technology movements. Being that my wife is a teacher, such improvements sound great to me.</p>

<p>In addition, my mother has been heavily involved in the movement for inclusion of special education students into general education classrooms in Chicago Public Schools; the above quote smacks of the future of inclusion in ways that my mother could only dream of a few years ago. Being able to cater curriculums to specific children to insure that those who are gifted in a subject are properly challenged and those that need help are similarly accommodated is a future in which I want to live.</p>
