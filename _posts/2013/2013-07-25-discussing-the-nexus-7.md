<p>Great conversation going on, with <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/07/24/tablet-share" title="Daring Fireball - Android Tablet Share">John Gruber</a> and <a href="http://verynicewebsite.net/2013/07/google-says-every-2-tablets-sold-in-2013-runs-android/" title="A Very Nice Website - Android Tablet Activations">John Moltz</a> putting in their two cents. Some of the activation versus usage questions definitely need to be answered prior to making any predictions about the future of the tablet landscape. Activations numbers are almost never indicative of real-world usage; <em>it seems especially so for Android tablets.</em></p>
