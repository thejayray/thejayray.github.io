<blockquote><div>
<p>When I looked at the link John Gruber posted to the new Bluetooth 4.0 tagging system called <a href="http://www.thetileapp.com/">Tile</a> I was surprised to see a lack of support for Android in the FAQ.</p>
</div></blockquote>

<p>Tile looks awesome and it is a shame that Android phones can&#8217;t use such a great new technology, but this is part of the problem of fragmentation as a whole; the platform on which said fragmentation occurs is technically irrelevant. Even if Android itself supported Bluetooth 4.0, that would not equate to a realistic support in devices. If I was an Android OEM, I&#8217;d be rushing to put out the exclusive Android phone that supported technology like Tile, maybe even partner with the company.</p>
