  <p>It’s simple: if you want time to slow down, become a student again. Learn something that requires sustained effort; do something novel. Put down the thriller when you’re sitting on the beach and break out a book on evolutionary theory or Spanish for beginners or a how-to book on something you’ve always wanted to do.</p>

<p>I often like the think of myself as the type of person who is always trying to learn something new. Apparently, the more I learn, the slower time will feel to me as I age; cool!</p>

<p>As I contemplate <a href="/2013/04/with-death-comes-new-life" title="With Death Comes New Life - Engineered Eloquence">becoming a father</a>, I know how fast everyone always says time goes, so this will have to become my tactic at slowing time down.</p>
