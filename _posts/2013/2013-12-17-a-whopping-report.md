Tweet: The Verge is ad-supported; I suspect that is indicative of their feelings on paying for apps.

<p>It’s a poor choice of words and probably even worse editing. Sarcasm isn’t a luxury journalists are afforded. I still think the comment reflects the overall state of thought around paid apps, however.</p>

<p>When discussing <em>The Information</em> <a href="/2013/12/the-information/" title="The Information - Engineered Eloquence">the other day</a>, I suggested that I didn&#8217;t care for a number of <em>The Verge</em>'s practices. I think <em>The Verge</em> happened to stumble upon a well-known sore spot for a lot of developers and technologists without realizing they were kicking a hornet&#8217;s nest with their self-professed &#8220;sarcasm&#8221;. Nevertheless, I had Mr. Hackett&#8217;s commentary in my to-share pile before the afore-quoted update was posted because the preference for free software in the app store has reached epidemic proportions. Of course, it doesn&#8217;t help when a site like <em>The Verge</em> decides to make stupid editing choices that just fuel the fire.<em><br/></em></p>
