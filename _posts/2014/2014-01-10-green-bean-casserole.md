title: Green Bean Casserole

Every so often I get a hankering for something less-than-good for me. A few days ago, that meal was green bean casserole and I thought I would (<em>finally</em>) share a recipe on this site like <a href="/2014/10/nesting/" title="Nesting - Engineered Eloquence">I promised I would</a>.

Before I go any further, however, I think I should clarify something first: I don't generally follow recipes. I may look up information on a specific preparation method or save a recipe to Basil for future meal ideas, but I am not the type of person who follows a recipe to a Tsp.<sup id="fnref:p72920409252-1"><a href="#fn:p72920409252-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> In addition, if there is taste I am going for, I will taste my specific product until it is exactly where I want it, not where a website or book suggests it should be. I felt like clarifying this about my cooking methods because when I share a link or recipe here, I want it to be clear that it is inevitable that I made something slightly or even completely different when I actually made the dish myself. Also, I work in approximates; my serving sizes and total times are rarely the same for myself and are variable based on a person's specific kitchen. I will list these in my recipes, but another cook's mileage may vary.

In preparation for green bean casserole, I grabbed out of my pantry a can of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup and a bag of green beans, but that seemed uninspired, especially given just how little nutritional value there is in <a href="http://www.campbellskitchen.com/recipes/classic-green-bean-casserole-24099" title="Campbell's Classic Green Bean Casserole Recipe">these types of recipes</a>. My wife and I have been on a Quinoa kick recently, so I thought I would look something up that included Quinoa.<sup id="fnref:p72920409252-2"><a href="#fn:p72920409252-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>  Not only was I pleasantly surprised by <a href="http://healthymamainfo.com/2013/04/quinoa-tomato-green-bean-casserole/" title="Quinoa, Tomato, Green Bean Casserole Recipe - HealthyMamaInfo">the recipe I found</a>, but my minor changes made the final product healthy and made me childishly nostalgic for the comfort food for which I was originally looking.

As I discussed in the afore-linked post, titled "Nesting", I have posted my recipe below as well as a link to put the recipe into the Basil Recipe App. Enjoy!

### ~Recipe Notes~

<ul><li>The original recipe called for different proportions of some of the ingredients. When I was creating my version of the dish, I knew that the addition of the soup would throw things off, so I used less Quinoa, but left the veggies as they were, more or less.</li>
<li>Goat Cheese or Feta would be a really good addition to this recipe, but not having either of those on-hand, we went for the trusty Wisconsin cheddar. The one note from my wife was that I didn't use enough cheese. Crazy Wisconsin women and their addictions to cheese aside, I agreed with her, which is why I took out the measurement for that ingredient. In addition, I would add multiple layers of cheese next time, but that is really personal preference.</li>
<li>Similarly, the original recipe used specific amounts of salt in various stages. I don't add a lot of salt to my meals, so I simply added salt where the taste might necessitate it. For ease of use, I left the spots where the original added salt anyway.</li>
<li>Finally, I used a bag of mixed frozen veggies for lack of the fresh version, but that did not change anything about the recipe in my opinion since the veggies are boiled until the desired tenderness is achieved.</li>
</ul>

For those who have seen (and have laughed at) the commercial about a tailgating husband whose wife has packed a Quinoa burger and he pronounces it QUEE-NO, it is funny but terribly undereducated, especially given the fact that Quinoa is a fantastic source of protein and fiber for vegetarians such as myself. <a href="#fnref:p72920409252-2" rev="footnote">↩</a>
