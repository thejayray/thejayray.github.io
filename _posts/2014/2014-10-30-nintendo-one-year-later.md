<blockquote>
  <p>I think it’s fair for Apple writers to complain about the fact that a lot of people who have no clue about how Apple’s business works make crazy pronouncements about what Apple should do. But I do think that they should measure their own expertise by the same yardstick. The fact that you have a lot of expertise about a specific company or a specific area of business does not mean that you have a lot of expertise about every company and every area of business.</p>
  
  <p>-Lukas Mathis, &#8220;Nintendo, one year later&#8221;, <em>ignore the code</em></p>

<p>I love this quote, especially because it is one of the article&#8217;s footnotes. I have linked to Mathis in the past due to his seemingly strong understand of the situation in which Nintendo exists and has existed for at least the past year. At that time, he was the only one clamoring for Nintendo <em>not</em> to start making iOS games and I can respect strong conviction, especially when the echo chamber is spouting something else. While he makes some great points about Nintendo&#8217;s current and future viability in his post (and you should go read the actual article), his comments in the above-quoted helped me to take him that much more seriously on this and possibly other topics.</p>
