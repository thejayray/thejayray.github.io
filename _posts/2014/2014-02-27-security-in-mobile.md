Tweet: Google, is now really the time to have such a nonchalant attitude toward security?

We all know by now that there was a huge security hole in Apple's iOS (and OS X) software that possibly would have allowed a mischievous—<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2014/02/apple_prism" title="On the Timing of iOS’s SSL Vulnerability and Apple’s ‘Addition’ to the NSA’s PRISM Program - Daring Fireball">possibly nefarious</a>—government agency to gain access to sensitive information on an Apple iOS device (or Mac).

<em>By the way, if you haven't done so already, please drop what you are doing and go to software update on every Apple device you own. <strong>Seriously, right now!</strong> I'll wait.</em>

Now that we have that out of the way, I wanted to post a quick blurb (read: rant) on security in mobile. Today, Apple released a white paper on iOS security, which begins as such:

<blockquote>
  "Apple designed the iOS platform with security at its core."
  
  (via <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/02/27/ios-security-paper">Daring Fireball: Apple Releases iOS Security White Paper</a>)
</blockquote>

How crazy is it that such a paper is released mere hours after Google's head of Android development says this amazingly stupid—although true—thing:

<blockquote>
  “We cannot guarantee that Android is designed to be safe… If I had a company dedicated to malware, I would also be addressing my attacks on Android.”
  
  (via <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/02/27/google-we-cant-guarantee-android-is-designed-to-be-safe/">Google: We can’t guarantee Android is designed to be safe</a>)
</blockquote>

First off, there is no way that the paper was written in response to Google's comments. Secondly, I say that the above statement is amazingly stupid due to the fact that Google has taken responsibility for Android in the past; they have incubated the platform, they have charged money to validate their hardware partners, and they have poured countless man-hours into making it one of the best mobile operating systems in the current tech landscape. <strong>Do these actions not intimate a modicum of accountability when the virtues of said OS are called into question?</strong> In addition, at a time when more and more people realize that they are being spied on, is now the time to have such a nonchalant attitude toward security.

Wow, Google. Just wow.
