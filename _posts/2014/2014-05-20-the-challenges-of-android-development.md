<blockquote>
  <p>We have been developing Bounden for Android alongside its development on iOS, and have tested the game on a number of devices. It was only a week ago that we started expanding our list of test devices, after we quickly discovered that:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>a) some devices had ‘broken’ gyroscopes that didn’t work on all axis,<br/>
    b) that some devices were faking gyroscopes by mixing and matching the accelerometer data with compass data, or<br/>
    c) that some devices did not have a gyroscope at all.</p>

<p>This, in a nutshell, is why I now own an iPhone.</p>
