<blockquote>
  <p>Not long after Tim Cook took over as full time CEO, he made a promise: “We’re going to double down on secrecy.” A few years on from that comment, it seems, as with most of Tim’s public comments, that it was more than just empty marketing speak. From the completely redesigned iOS 7 in 2013, to the launch of a whole new programming language, Swift, at this years WWDC, to the announcements that are about to be unveiled, Apple are tighter lipped and appear to be more controlled than ever.</p>

<p>I wrote this sentiment almost literally verbatim about a month ago, but never published. That James Gill is a smart guy; I wonder why he writes on Medium, then.</p>
