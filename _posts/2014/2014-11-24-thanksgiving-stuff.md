<p>Tools and Toys has a great-looking rundown of the things you may need for this week/weekend, including items for all sorts of cooking and entertainment. I just bought all the versions of Paprika Recipe App to try out because they are on sale right now at close to 50% off.<sup><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a></sup> In addition, though, they have included a number of books and music suggestions that will hopefully please everyone.</p>

<p>I say close to 50% because the iOS apps are 40% off ($2.99 down from $4.99). However, the Mac app is actually 50% off ($9.99 down from $19.99), so if you buy all three, the total price comes in at just over 53% off ($15.97 down from $29.97); what a deal! <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
