<blockquote>
  <p>In a small way, using the Watch, Apple is trying to create a new way to communicate that can capture some of that emotion. Because the Watch can effectively “tap” your wrist, others can tap out a pattern on their Watch, and it will re-create those taps on your wrist, almost like they are tapping you themselves. You could send a tap-tap to your partner’s wrist while they are away on a trip just to say that you’re thinking about them. Isn’t that so much more meaningful a way to say it than a text message saying it? Doesn’t it carry more emotion and resonance?</p>

<p>The personal (read: more human) and beautifully emotional parts of the Apple&#8217;s new Watch are what intrigue me the most and make me think that in order for the watch to be truly useful to me, I am going to have to buy one for my wife as well.</p>

<p>My heart will feel deep pangs of love, just as my wallet feels pangs of a different sort.</p>
