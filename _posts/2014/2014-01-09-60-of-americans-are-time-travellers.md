<p><strong>Two words:</strong> <a href="http://www.vcrplus.com/home.asp">VCR Plus+</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Crazy by itself. But even crazier when I realize: I don’t even have a DVD player in my home anymore.</p></blockquote>

<p>I digitized all the DVDs in my collection about two years ago. I have since been giving away my DVDs to friends and family who still own that technology. The closest thing that I own to a DVD player is an iMac, which sits in our office/guest bedroom, so not in a place that is often used for movie watching. My wife&#8217;s family, every so often, gives us DVDs as gifts, which I promptly digitize, using said iMac, and give away, or else, put in my pile of DVDs that no one wants. I don&#8217;t consider myself to be special in this regard, but I know that my wife&#8217;s parents still have a DVD player, VCR, and a host of VHS tapes and DVDs that they still use. Hell, my parents still own a cassette player!</p>
