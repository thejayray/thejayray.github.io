>Consider a simple cup for dispensing liquid meds, below — it has both teaspoons and milliliters on it. That, as Bridget Kuehn reported, makes it easier for people to give the wrong dose. (And because 1 teaspoon just happens to be equal to 5 milliliters, it’s likely that a wrong dose would be off by a factor of five.)

With my undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering, I had to learn and use the metric system constantly for school and I loved how easy it was to work with. I agree with Ms. Locke that it is time for the US to metric-ulate (pun intended). What is most telling to me, though, is that there are still two places where I use it in my day to day life: my infant daughter's medications and my coffee. *Neither of those places does one really want to mess around with rounding or approximation errors.*
