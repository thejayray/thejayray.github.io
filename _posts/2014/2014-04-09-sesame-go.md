<p>Sesame Go is like HBO Go for families! (But hopefully <a href="https://twitter.com/parislemon/status/452977808394821632" title="HBONoGo - ParisLemon Twitter">more reliable</a>.)</p>

<p>I know I haven&#8217;t posted in awhile, which I will blame on my new job, but maybe you can forgive me since this post is awesome! I will simply echo <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2014/04/09/sesame-go/" title="Sesame Go - The Loop">Jim Dalrymple&#8217;s sentiment</a>: I wish this was available when I was a kid.</p>
