  <p>And thus, Tim may have kicked off a shift from the intersection of technology and liberal arts to the intersection of technology and style. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, it’s just different.</p>

<p>Mr. Siegler&#8217;s post is one of the most level-headed discussions of the Apple event that I have read thus far, especially vis-á-vis <a href="/2014/09/wwsjd-is-no-longer-important/" title="WWSJD is No Longer Important - Engineered Eloquence">my earlier post</a>. Perhaps the true difference between the iPhone&#8217;s introduction by Steve Jobs and the Watch&#8217;s introduction by Tim Cook has more to do with the message itself <sup id="fnref:p97575000315-1"><a href="#fn:p97575000315-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> than it has to do with the products. I will give Apple this, though: they thought differently about the Watch than did any other smartwatch contender currently on the market.</p>

<p>The iPhone was a reinvention of the phone in its capabilities outside of the Phone application; the Watch is a reinvention of what a <em>watch</em> is capable of, while still remaining first and foremost a best-in-class <em>watch</em>, even if it is smart. <a href="#fnref:p97575000315-1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
