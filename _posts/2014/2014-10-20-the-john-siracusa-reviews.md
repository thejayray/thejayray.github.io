<blockquote>
  <p>Viewed in isolation, Yosemite provides a graphical refresh accompanied by a few interesting features and several new technologies whose benefits are mostly speculative, depending heavily on how eagerly theyâ€™re adopted by third-party developers. But Apple no longer views the Mac in isolation, and neither should you. OS X is finally a full-fledged peer to iOS; all aspects of sibling rivalry have been banished.</p>
  
  <p>-John Siracusa, &#8220;OS X 10.10 Yosemite: The Ars Technica Review&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>John Siracusa has mentioned on a number of occasion that this may be his last review of OS X, as he started writing them at Developer Preview 2 and I have to say, I think this one is his best yet. I have been reading them since Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard and so they generally hold a special place in my heart, but this year was different for me, so my laud of the review might be a bit biased.</p>

<p>In previous years, I read the review as a technologist and interested consumer, often skipping the technical overviews that had nothing to do with my daily work. This year, I was reading it as a system administrator, deeply interested in the under the hood changes that have been made in this release, which includes the not insignificant introduction of the Swift programming language.</p>

<p>No matter what the filter through which I see the Yosemite review, however, I  quoted the above paragraph due to both its power of insight as well as its ability to be a good send off for Siracusa should this actually be his last OS X review for Ars Technica. If you read nothing else about OS X Yosemite, read the last &#8220;page&#8221; this review, which includes the Recommendations and Conclusions sections.</p>

<p>Thank you for your work, sir.</p>
