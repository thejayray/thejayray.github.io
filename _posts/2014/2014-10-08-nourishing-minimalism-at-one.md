<p>Emphases exist in original post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Having very few actual toys means their imagination has room to work. They can imagine with <em>anything</em>. Even with having an abundance of toys, I see little ones playing with their siblings shoes, “cooking” in the kitchen or  talking for popsicle stick people instead. <strong>This is a good thing and we need to continue to encourage them to play, learn and imagine with items that don’t already “do-it-all” for them.</strong></p>

<p>With my daughter&#8217;s first birthday coming up, my wife and I have been struggling with the discussion of toys as gifts, especially given the fact that our house is slowly being taken over by toys already. Not only does one need to think about storage of toys that grow in size as the child grows, but also the question of what happens, if anything, with the toys that are no longer of value, both developmentally and metaphysically, to our child.</p>

<p>We, therefore, shared the above-linked post with our family and friends in the party invitation, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are looking for gift ideas, you can visit [this link] as a place to start, though your presence, support, or thoughts from afar will be enough of a gift for our beautiful, growing girl.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems reasonable to us; we are not specifically asking that they not bring toys, but we are asking for restraint should the question be: &#8220;What do you buy a one year old who already has <em>a lot</em> of toys?&#8221; We also understand that the post is about toddlers and not one year olds, but at the same time, quite a few of the items on the list would assist my wife and me in introducing our daughter to new things to help her continue to grow and develop in the ways that we desire, not least among them an understanding that minimalism (and restraint) is something to be cherished.</p>
