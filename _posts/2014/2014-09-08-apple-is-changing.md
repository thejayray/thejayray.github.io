<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t know what Apple is planning for their watch — I only know what I want them to do. There are signs that Apple is changing. There are strong signs their design aesthetic is changing. But Apple is still about owning the profit share in their markets and building high quality products at comfortable margins. Unless that is changed, I expect the Apple watch to be less smart than expected — but much more beautiful.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be honest, I don&#8217;t think any of what Mr. Rhyne discusses in his post will come to fruition tomorrow, but I think the conclusion (quoted above) is spot on. Apple is changing in many ways, but what hasn&#8217;t changed is its ability to create the unexpected and beautiful.</p>
