<blockquote>
  <p>But IE6 won’t die. In China, its usage still represents over 10 percent of web visits; in most other countries, it’s below one percent. Weighted by all desktop users, however, Microsoft (using Net Applications data) pegs IE as 3.8 percent of global use. With hundreds of millions of desktop computer users worldwide, this translates to tens of millions of IE 6 users.</p>

<p>I knew that IE 6 was <em>still</em> being used, but I had no idea it was as big a number as this article suggests. The moral of the story is: if you are a server admin, please help everyone out and disable SSLv3 on your servers, so people know it is simply unacceptable to still be using IE 6 in this day and age.</p>

<p><strong>Sidenote</strong>: I think it is really cool that Jason Snell, owner of Six Colors, is running his blog with bylines much like the company that recently closed his beloved MacWorld magazine. Keep up the good work, Jason.</p>
