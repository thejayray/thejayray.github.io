<p>Although I don&#8217;t often link to items from Facebook, I actually think this product might be good. As if we needed yet another app called &#8220;Paper&#8221;, but otherwise rather intriguing. I found the promotional video quite interesting as well in that it mirrors what Apple attempts to do with its ads, draw people in with the humanity of a product instead of flashing the product itself.</p>

<p>The title link goes to the promotional website, but if you&#8217;d rather, <a href="https://fbcdn-dragon-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/t39.2365/851559_578934018851295_1147417154_n.mp4" title="Paper by Facebook Video">this link</a> leads directly to the promotional video, which was strangely a downloadable mp4 file with no embed code on the promotional website. Take a look.</p>
