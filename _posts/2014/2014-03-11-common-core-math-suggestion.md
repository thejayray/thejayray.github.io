<p>I hadn&#8217;t seen the &#8220;new way to do subtraction&#8221; until recently, but I was always a math kid, so I read this quick little article on it. The idea of counting up to get to an answer for a subtraction problem seems counterintuitive, but as Mr. Hermant Mehta suggests if it teaches math in a  way that makes more complex math easier to learn, why not? Especially in an age of standardized testing and real-world &#8220;word problems&#8221;, I&#8217;ll go back to my old adage: &#8220;As long as you learn the material, does it really matter how you got there?&#8221;</p>
