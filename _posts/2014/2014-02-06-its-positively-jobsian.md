<p>No matter how little I care about the new Microsoft CEO, Ben Thompson has a fascinating insight into the moves to get Bill Gates back into the decision-making fold at Microsoft. The best line:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Taken together, it’s difficult to escape the conclusion that Gates is back, with Nadella on board to handle the non-product and time-consuming aspects of being public-company CEO. It’s positively Jobsian.</p>
