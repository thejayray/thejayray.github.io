<blockquote>
  <p>It all started with a hat.</p>
  
  <p>Several months ago, one of my anonymous Pixar Theory Interns (that’s a thing on a resume) came to me with a crazy proposition: Andy’s mom is [REDACTED].</p>
  
  <p>I laughed. I then agreed.</p>

<p>Fascinating! Who is Andy&#8217;s mom anyway and have those sneaky scoundrels at Pixar pulled one over on us all? Really, the whole idea makes me think of Pixar&#8217;s attention to detail as resembling Apple&#8217;s; how deep into a story (or backstory for that matter) do these wizards of cinema go before plotting out the first movie, let alone its sequels? Click-through to check out the full logic.</p>

<p>One last thing, I would love (and share) any post that ends with this line:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Or, do you hate fun, love, and destiny?"</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
