>Handoff is nice, but I don't know how much I'd ever use it in practice (this has been the case with Handoff in general for me). If you're reading an article in Instapaper, you can quickly resume your activity on another device from the Lock screen; if you don't have Instapaper installed on the second device, Handoff will open the article in Safari using its source URL.

This is one of those rare occasions where I disagree with Federico. Handoff is one of those features that I look for in the apps that I use and the fact that Instapaper was able to pull it off without having a stand-alone desktop application is frankly impressive. In addition, the new look of the bookmarklet and share extensions make this an instant update candidate for me.

I have been beta testing Instapaper, as I am a subscriber and signed up for their early access program, and the steady improvements that I have seen in each of these releases remind me that Marco Arment knew what he was doing when he put Instapaper in Betworks' hands.
