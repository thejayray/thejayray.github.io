<blockquote>
  <p>I understand that there are few businesses out there with higher stakes than the Windows business for Microsoft. And on one hand, you have to give them credit for trying something a little different. But all they had to do was talk to a handful of developers and/or users who were testing early builds of the product — as I did — to know that it was going to be a total shitshow.</p>
  
  <p>Instead, they shipped.</p>

<p>There was something missing from MG&#8217;s account of the Windows 8 launch that I feel needs to be said. Not only did Microsoft not discuss their new OS with the devs and users that would have clearly told them they were shipping a lemon but they decided to make the lemon the only version of Windows available to the public at launch. Windows 7 was considered by Microsoft to be old, so they took it off the shelves and forced all new OEM computers to have Windows 8. If nothing else, that move cemented Windows, and more importantly Microsoft, as being out of touch, as lacking the foresight to reach the current crop of computer users.</p>
