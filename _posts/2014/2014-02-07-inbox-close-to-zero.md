<p>With these two punches to the stomach in mind, I rebooted my inbox during the holidays with these fixes. Some are essential and some are personal, but I believe all are valuable. </p>
<ul><li>Anything more than ten or so emails in your inbox might as well be a bajillion.</li>
<li>Stop hoarding. Start archiving.</li>
<li>Use conversation/threaded view.</li>
<li>A strict to-do transfer policy.</li>

<p>Being unemployed right now, I don&#8217;t get a whole lot of email that is urgent, but I have always been of the opinion that I do email quite well, especially in comparison to some. I am at Inbox Zero or Inbox Close-to-Zero almost all the time because I unsubscribe like a fiend, act immediately on things in my inbox, and know myself well enough to only check my email a couple times a day, so as to keep email from consuming my life. Nevertheless, Michael Lopp has written a detailed review of his own methods and how they have failed. His steps to get better with his email are those listed above, which he details more in the full post. Hopefully he is successful in his moves to have fewer dropped email threads.</p>
