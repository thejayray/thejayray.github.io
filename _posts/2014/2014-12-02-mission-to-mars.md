I once dreamt of becoming an Astronaut, as most children do, but I went on to get my undergraduate degree in engineering and desperately tried to get into an internship with NASA while in school. I held fast to that dream until I was a sophomore, at which time I fell in love with technology support and the woman who would be become my wife. 

Nevertheless, reading something like NASA's post rekindles those not-so-forgotten desires and all I can think now is, "I would have been the perfect age for that mission."
