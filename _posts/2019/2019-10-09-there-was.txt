Yet another shooting <br>
Yet another scandal<br>
Yet another reason <br>
To fly right off the handle<br>

Yet another talking point<br>
Yet another obscenity<br>
Yet another person tokenized<br>
For their identity<br>

Yet another news cycle<br>
Yet another death<br>
Yet another thing to think through<br>
When you want to take a breath<br>

Yet another "honest mistake"<br>
Yet another meme<br>
Yet another truthful joke<br>
That things are scarier than they seem<br>
