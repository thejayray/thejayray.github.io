That one time I tried to learn Spanish<br>
That one time I failed<br>
That one time I learned from my mistakes<br>
And found the not-so-holy grail<br>

That one time I sang a song<br>
That one time I wrote it<br>
That one time I knew better<br>
But was utterly cause devoted<br>

That one time I should have shared<br>
That one time I didn't<br>
That one time I overreacted<br>
To a problem consistently intermittent<br>

That one time I went to church<br>
That one time I flew through the air<br>
That one time I realized<br>
The truth is in everywhere<br>
