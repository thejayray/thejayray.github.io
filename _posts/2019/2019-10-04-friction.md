There is no better reason to not do something<br>
There is no better reason to try<br>
There is no better reason to fight<br>
Against tyranny and strife<br>

Removal is often the goal<br>
Removal is often the challenge<br>
Removal is often not enough<br>
To completely fix what hangs in the balance<br>

But it can bring about great change<br>
But it can bring light<br>
But it can bring great joys<br>
In the darkness of the night<br>

And so I live with friction<br>
And so I live with what is hard<br>
And so I live with what I love<br>
But I stay upon my guard<br>
