Tweet: I can't add anything to this fantastic rant about sleep from @benjaminbrooks, but I agree with every word.

>I have friends with babies they place in the crib for naps or bed and that baby will sleep for the next 8-12 hours straight. Mine only slept for four hours straight for the first 8 months of their lives. But as they get older, they generally sleep better. You have this kid living with you for the next 18 years, so 8 months of shit sleep is a pretty small amount. Just remember how much you slept in high school â€” man am I looking forward to those days.
