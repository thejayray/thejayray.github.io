Recently, my family took a trip to Myrtle Beach, SC; we decided to save money by driving there, which—had we driven straight through the trip would have taken about 15 hours—in hindsight seems like a terrible idea. The thing about vacation that I realized over the course of the break and the requisite travels there and back was the fact that vacation is about relaxation and the journey back home negates any progress one has made on that front. Travel isn't relaxing, it's stressful; it doesn't matter how long the trip is, if it is by plane, train, bus, or car, or even if you like the people you are doing it with. The above image has nothing to do with the stresses of travel, but it does have to do with stress on vacation. Being that its sentiment is true, I thought it particularly poignant, as I settle back into my work after having been gone for a week. I'm thinking next year's Spring Break may have to be a vacation in which I stay home to find rest.
