title: [Yet Another Idea Left](http://qz.com/338767/the-man-who-brought-us-the-lithium-ion-battery-at-57-has-an-idea-for-a-new-one-at-92/)

Fascinating profile of the man that invented the basis for the current prevailing battery technology, lithium-ion. He has a great outlook on life, a (secret) new great idea, and a great laugh. At 92, he is still doing amazing things and should be a testiment to all those that believe there is a time limit on child-like curiosity.

Lexi's great-grandfather's birthday was a few days ago and he would have been 99. He was still sharp as a tack and definitely ambitious at the time he died just four short years ago. His ambitions were not of a scientific nature, but he lived in his later years, as he did in his younger years: full of curiosity and vigor.

I hope I am able to be as interesting as these two men as I age.
