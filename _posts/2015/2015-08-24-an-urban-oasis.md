Kimball Avenue Church has nurtured a corner farm that works to feed the neighborhood, making what was once a building a much more powerful profession of faith through the feeding of the body.

They want to expand that ministry to feed the soul in the form of a prayer labyrinth. You can help recoup the land that was once a beautiful church, lost to a boiler explosion, into a prayer labyrinth that will serve the Logan Square neighborhood and the world; all are welcome!
