Tweet: For my second outing on @withSpoken, I discuss new year's resolutions and embracing simplicity.
title: 2016 or Embracing Simplicity

Today, I posted my second recording on Spoken; as before, I have also included a transcript of the audio. Enjoy.

2016 will be all about simplicity for me.

In previous years, I have gone with two general use cases:
1. I have had resolutions and I have made the obvious decision to shirk them.
2. I have decided to not make a resolution at all.

New Years resolutions don't work for most people because they lack accountability and they don't feel forced to continue after that point-of-no-return that ends in missed opportunities. However, I have [Shawn Blanc](http://shawnblanc.net) at my side. In his recent online course, [The Elements of Focus](https://thefocuscourse.com), I have been following along with each of his ideas and I love what Shawn and his work stands for: understanding yourself, your motivations, and acting on those motivations.

For me, the one thing that has come out of all this learning is a better understanding of myself in that I crave simplicity. This craving comes out in my minimalist tendencies, my frugality, and, recently, inbox zero in my work and personal lives, among *many* other things. But the reason I bring this up is that simplicity is an overarching theme in my life and I want to better focus on that in the coming year. This is *not* a resolution, this is a fundamental shift  in perception.

Simplicity has to be included in every facet of one's life or else it means nothing. Below is a list of examples of the "accomplishments" and ideas, though not exhaustive, on which I would like to focus in the new year through this new lens of simplicity:

+ **Written**: What are my [priorities](https://thefocuscourse.com/class/8-how-to-prioritize.html) and what is taking away from my focus on those priorities? Also, what is my [life vision](https://thefocuscourse.com/class/6-how-to-get-a-vision.html)?
+ **Physical**: Trim my material possessions, including clothing (if I don't wear it, I shouldn't have it) and technology (if I don't use it, I shouldn't have it).
+ **Technological**: Rethink my online presence (I used this service once, do I need to continue to have an account with them now? Who am I keeping this account for? If not me, delete it).
+ **Focused**: Spend more time in contemplation (sans technology), potentially with music, journaling, doodling and coloring, reading physical books, etc.

Since this is not a resolution, there is no way to "fail"; this thought process will be a conscious and conscientious rethinking of each part of my day, each decision I make, throughout the coming year. So here's to 2016.
