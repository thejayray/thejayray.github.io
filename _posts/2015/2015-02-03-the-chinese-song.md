Back in December, I [linked](http://www.engineeredeloquence.com/2014/12/the-song/) to Apple's Holiday Ad, entitled "The Song", which was [another](http://www.engineeredeloquence.com/2013/12/misunderstood-electronics/ "Misunderstood Electronics - Engineered Eloquence") Apple Ad for the holidays that pulled on our collective heart strings. Cooler still, however, was Apple's move to recreate the ad for Chinese New Year. I had come across it in a MacRumors write-up and saved it to watch for later. Just this morning, I finally got around to watching it and frankly it is better in my opinion than the original, especially the ending. I would link the video directly here, but Apple did not post the video in an easily embeddable form, so click-through and enjoy!
