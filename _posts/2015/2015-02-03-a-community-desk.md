Tweet: John Saddington's Desk (@deskpm) is more than an app, it is a community endeavor; that's why it is succesful.

>It’s also worth noting that Desk gets a lot of marketing (at the cost of the creator’s time, rather than money) in addition to paid advertising. Saddington blogs frequently, has a regular email newsletter, and releases short videos quite often. All of which are full of great advice for indies.

>-Joe Cieplinski, "Investing in Your Apps"

Joe has a good analysis of John Saddington's [original blog post](http://blog.desk.pm/2014-yir/ "Desk App’s 2014 Year in Review") about the profitability and growth of his blogging app, Desk. In the end, Joe's point has to do with the fact that John took good risks that have paid off in the form of ads and marketing. Throughout the whole post, I was nodding my head for two reasons: I agree that John's choices were the right ones, especially for this type of application, and, being a recent Desk purchaser, I visit [the Desk support site](http://support.desk.pm "Desk App Community and Support") a lot suddenly.

One would think that you visit a support site when something is broken, but John has instead created something novel with his support site: a community in which users of the app can share blog posts, feature requests, and much more. John is highly active in this space and has even read a few of my personal blog posts because of it. That is the type of development that I want to support: the type that creates a community and the type where app development is a shared journey between the developer and the users. Keep up the good work, John!
