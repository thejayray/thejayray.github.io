Tweet: WWDC, oculus, and some miscellany, but really WWDC takes the cake in this week's roundup.
title: "Eloquent Roundup: WWDC"

One major thing happened this week: WWDC. I would be remiss to not link to the writing surrounding it since I spent most of my free time obsessing about the announcements and subsequent coverage. In addition, Oculus announced the consumer version of its [Rift virtual reality headset](https://www.oculus.com/en-us/rift/), so naturally I link to a Wired article that was written in June of 2014, just after the Facebook purchase. And a couple other cool things that crossed my radar are noted at the bottom.

## Oculus

[The Inside Story of Oculus Rift and How Virtual Reality Became Reality - Wired](http://www.wired.com/2014/05/oculus-rift-4/) (Originally read in print):

> This was the problem with virtual reality. It couldn’t just be really good. It had to be perfect. In a traditional videogame, too much latency is annoying—you push a button and by the time your action registers onscreen you’re already dead. But with virtual reality, it’s nauseating. If you turn your head and the image on the screen that’s inches from your eyes doesn’t adjust instantaneously, your visual system conflicts with your vestibular system, and you get sick.

A portion of an old Michael Crichton book, Disclosure, talks about VR as a technological aside, the likes for which Michael Crichton was known. The reason I bring that up is twofold: it has taken this long (the book was written in the early 90s) to get the technology right and Crichton jokes in the book that in development, many guinea pigs of the system would get sick. I reference something from the 90s, but Palmer Lucky, the founder of Oculus, brought up the fact that just four years ago some of the things they announced yesterday would seem like science fiction. We shall see if they offer something compelling to the masses when the product is released in Q1 2016.
