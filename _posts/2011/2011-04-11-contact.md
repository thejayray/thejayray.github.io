I just finished Carl Sagan’s novel, Contact. Ever since I knew the movie, of which I am a big fan, was based on a book, I have wanted to read it. I first found out this information two weeks ago. I raced through the book and wanted to share a few of the good quotes I collected from the book. I especially enjoyed the subtle but important themes of scientifically-based theology since I tend to think of myself as a scientifically well-informed Christian. As most of my friends know as well, I had aspirations of becoming an astronaut until I was well into my 20s. Enjoy the quotes and let me know your thoughts.

> Human speech is like a cracked kettle on which we tap crude rhythms for bears to dance to, while we long to make music to melt the stars. -Gustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary (1857)

> In the long run, the aggressive civilizations destroy themselves, almost always. It’s their nature. -p359, Ch 20: Grand Central Station

> If there was content inside the transcendental number, it could only have been built into the geometry of the universe from the beginning. This project of hers was in experimental theology. But so is all of science, she thought. -p426, Ch 24: The Artist’s Signature

Thoughts?
