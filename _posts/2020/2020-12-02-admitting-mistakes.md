title: Admitting Mistakes
---

Something I know to be true about myself now more than ever is a desire to keep things simple. This includes a number of (if not all) areas of my life but includes my approach to technology, relationships, and money.

The convergence of factors that led to [The Pivot](/2020/10/the-pivot) were within this realm and all logical.
+ Technology: “I want to move away from Dropbox to simplify where my documents live.”
+ Relationships: “I want to go where others seem to be, namely GitHub Pages.”
+ Money: “I want to save a few bucks since I don’t need all the features of my current platform.”

However, the factors as a whole missed a few niceties that were not logical. In other words, I missed the trees for the forest. The details of the way I ran the blog equated to a simplicity that when moved to a more complex platform, got in the way of creation. I spent time getting the space to look the way I wanted or, better put, the same and there was exhilaration in the ramp up as there often is, but once the dust settled, was I better for it?

A few things stuck out:
+ Technology: “GitHub keeps throwing generic build errors when nothing looks wrong and there’s no direct support when I need it nor logs for me to visit to check.”
+ Relationships: “Nash is still on Blot, so my interactions with him will necessitate being familiar with two platforms.”
+ Money: “The peace of mind and simplicity of the UI was worth a few dollars.”

So I reached out to the Blot developer and had a conversation; I admitted my mistakes and sought grace for a return to simplicity and in the process decided it was time for change. If [The Other Pivot](/2020/10/the-other-pivot) is to be believed, I’m writing with more frequency and more focus.

In addition to the above, I have rethought everything about the site. Since I am physically incapable of taking things lightly, I rebuilt it from the ground up with simplicity in mind. Again, the three aforementioned focuses to explain:
+ Technology: This site is running on very little in terms of structure with minimal extras and a focus on simple navigation and layout. I intend to add more to the homepage to feature some things, but those will be seen through a more minimalistic lens.
+ Relationships: I am back to sending the Blot developer bug reports frequently since beta testing is a true passion of mine and has been for some time. I have already updated [Nash's site](https://nashp.com) with a few things I have learned in rebuilding my own. I made a new online friend with the publishing of [Minimalist Guilt](/2020/11/minimalist-guilt).
+ Money: I am happy to support an independent developer on an independent platform. [You can, too!](https://blot.im/)

I made a mistake in moving away from Blot in the first place, whether the initial reasoning was logical or not; making and admitting mistakes is a good lesson to revisit periodically anyway.
