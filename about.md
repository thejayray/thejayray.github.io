When I first created this page based off of [Nash's Help page](https://nashp.com/help), I intended it to focus on those things I could do to help others with their web presence. My intent is now to open up my space to others that need their voice to be heard.

So in the box below, share your thoughts or ask for help. If you would like a response or to be attributed to the comments, share your name and email address, but feel free to remain anonymous. I hope this message finds you well and I hope I can help no matter your current situation.

**Note**: If you'd prefer, you can just [email me][1].
