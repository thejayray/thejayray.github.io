## About the Site

Engineered Eloquence was born out of my desire to make a more concerted effort to document my thoughts and life. This is version 7 of the Engineered Eloquence site (no science went into that version number) and with it, I am working on a more focused, more intentional site that I can look back on with pride ten years from now. *There will be a lot of 404 errors as I pare down the archive of content. Reach out if you want to read something from the annals.*

## About the Design

TBD. (See [Letting Go](/2022/11/letting-go))

## Some Relevant History

In 2009, I started using Tumblr as a blogging platform. Prior to that, I had a few side projects that helped me gain an understanding of web technologies, all the way back to a website run on Apple's .Mac service using iWeb to build it. 

The freedom of posting whatever I wanted to Tumblr with easy-to-use tools was the perfect way to get involved in the social media scene of the time. Looking back, I am astounded how little of what I wrote and shared matters to me now. However, I kept those posts, even transitioning them to my current site to allow for a record of my time on the web.

I have moved the site between providers multiple times and was on Blot from 2015-2022 due to simplicity and an ongoing developer relationship. As with all things, eventually change is inevitable and we need to be intentional with the tools we use and why. I moved back to GitHub Pages in large part because the site needs to continue to evolve and be as simple as possible to keep my interest.

## Support the site

I have never had ads on my websites, save for a short stint back in the late 2000s, when online ads were less intrusive and earned me basically nothing. I will continue to write and post, all without monetizing it, but if you want to support my writing, do so through PayPal here: <a href="https://paypal.me/engineeredeloquence">Engineered Eloquence</a>.
