Engineered Eloquence was born out of my desire to make a more concerted effort to document my thoughts and life. The site has had a number of different designs, hosting providers, and goals over the years, but it has always been a place for me to play with the web, reflect on life and technology, and share my thoughts.

This is version 7 of the Engineered Eloquence site and with it, I am working on a more focused, more intentional space that I can look back on with pride ten years from now. *There will be a lot of 404 errors as I pare down the archive of content.

## About the Design

This site runs on GitHub Pages, intentionally with minimal structure and code. This time around, I wanted to use something utilitarian, which led me to Riccardo Graziosi's "No Style, Please" Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages. I took that as a template and started making it my own as I often do with these types of things. The below-listed items are noteworthy in the infrastructure and design.

+ Lightly modified version of the [No Style, Please](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please) Jekyll theme
+ Engineered Eloquence red ([#BF2E3D](https://www.colorhexa.com/bf2e3d)) used tastefully throughout

## Some Relevant History

In 2009, I started using Tumblr as a blogging platform. Prior to that, I had a few side projects that helped me gain an understanding of web technologies, all the way back to a website run on Apple's .Mac service using iWeb to build it. 

The freedom of posting whatever I wanted to Tumblr with easy-to-use tools was the perfect way to get involved in the social media scene of the time. Looking back, I am astounded how little of what I wrote and shared matters to me now. I have a record of those posts, even transitioning them all to the previous version of the site to allow for a record of my time on the web, but in the move to the current site architecture, I decided to curate the published items, only keeping live those that are important to the journey: *my writing*.

I have moved the site between providers multiple times and was on Blot from 2015-2022 due to simplicity and an ongoing developer relationship. As with all things, change is inevitable and we need to be intentional with the tools we use and why. I moved back to GitHub Pages in large part because the site needs to continue to evolve and be as simple as possible to allow me to focus on the content.

## Support the site

I have never had ads on my websites, save for a short stint back in the late 2000s, when online ads were less intrusive and earned me basically nothing. I will continue to write and post, all without monetizing it, but if you want to support my writing, do so through PayPal here: <a href="https://paypal.me/engineeredeloquence">Engineered Eloquence</a>.

Thank you for reading and taking this journey with me.
